   (21 cases were excluded due to the invalid value (age). Excluded cases are 4, 16, 17, 35, 39, 40, 42, 46, 57, 70, 76, 77, 88, 95, 179, 189, 190, 192, 199, 204, 206).

       I was 14 at that time when super Yolanda destroyed our home. During the super typhoon, we stayed in Tacloban City. We were lucky that our subdivision is far from the ocean, so we never experienced the storm surge that killed thousands of people. But the water coming from the mountain is no different. Because of the water rushing down from the mountain flooded our whole community. Because of the strong wind our ceiling was destroyed, trapping us from the inside. This experience stands out the most because I have no certainty if I can survive this or I can make it out alive and unscathed. I was so scared, we were so scared that our walls might collapse. This really affects how we think and prepare for future similar situations.

       I was 19 at that time. before I went to sleep, one of my high school friends messaged me about what had happened. He told me that my  friend Carla, had just lost his brother and added that he hanged himself in their bedroom. I wasn¡¯t able to sleep well that night as I try to imagine the scenario and why he had done it to himself. I should have checked him before the event happened that night. I began to doubt myself and the things I have learned as a Psychology student.
       3
       I was 19 when they fought again. I was 20 a few days later and they were still fighting. They were fighting something about my father going to some events drunk and at night. My mother was not permitting it but he was insisting. They also fought about what they were going to do on my birthday because my father was not answering my mother. It was really stressful and really horrible. I never interfered with their fights. When I was young, the last time a fight this magnitude happened was way back on Christmas Eve 2016. It was really horrible to the point that I had to interfere. This time, my way of interference was in the form of an extremely long text message that I sent to both of them. I told them my feelings regarding their fight. I told them how I had these horrible thoughts that I never expressed to them because I didn¡¯t trust them. I told them many things in that message. As much as I wish for it not to happen again, it most probably will happen again. This experience stands out because I¡¯ve been experiencing it for more than a decade. The fights caused me ceaseless anxiety every time I¡¯m in the house and they¡¯re not talking to each other. Its really horrible and I feel really butter that I¡¯m always made to feel this way. This experience and all other past experiences of their fights created negative psychological impact on me. I never told them that their fights caused something in me. I guess, even now, I still don¡¯t trust them. I probably never will. If ever I do have children, I don¡¯t want them to experience something like this to happen.

       I was in my 3rd year HS when this event occurred. I was turning 15 that month. We were separated from our parents and other older relatives as we were forced to stay in the evacuation area. We saw how scary this typhoon could get as the rooftop were blown away and even the establishments. The water was rising fast and you could hear the wind whistling like a pig. At first, I was not worried but as I went out of the room, I saw how disastrous it is and I saw bloated dead people outside the building we¡¯re staying. On the other hand, parent and relatives that were in our house was about to experience the near to death situation as the water was rising on our second floor. They also helped and let our neighbors stay in our house while the event was happening. This experience stood out the most since it is my first time witnessing and experiencing such an event. This event let out the crippling fear in me about losing my relatives and parents. I don¡¯t want to be left by them, it made me cherish and treasure them more. 
       6
       I was around 13 yrs. Old when super typhoon Yolanda happened. I was seeing houses totally wrecked, roofs flying, coconut trees cut, and the ground was shaking. We (my entire family) were staying at my Lola¡¯s (grandmother¡¯s) house when I witnessed the event disaster happened, I was trembling in fear and the thought that I would probably die. Perhaps, the endurance and strength I was able to have during and after the calamity. 
       7
       I was 13 yrs. Old. I was at home together with my mother and siblings. But my father was I Naval. The winds and rain were too strong. My neighbor¡¯s roof was blown away, their house was crumbling to the ground defenseless against the Supertyphoon Yolanda. I was really scared because Tatay (father) wasn¡¯t with us. But most of all I was scared when I saw our neighbor holding their baby showed up on our window, drenched, asking for help. I thought that we would be unsuccessful in helping them to come to our house. I think super typhoon Yolanda made me realize that humans are defenseless when it comes to nature. It made me think that we are too fragile as humans and that our life is short, as cliche as it may sound. And I would always remember this experience as a precautionary situation for me to always be prepared and ready for whatever life throws at myself.
       8
       I was 14 yrs old when everything just went downhill. Well, he was using drugs, too much drugs. He was losing it.  At our house, I think it was a weekday (?). My family, uncles, grandmother and aunt. It really threw me off and made me develop odd habits, like running to my room whenever I would hear the sound of a motorcycle cause then I would associate it with his ride. Going home late so that I wouldn¡¯t have to deal with him and the problems around it. I would often shake and cover myself with a blanket whilst sandwiching myself between pillows and the wall to make it look as if I was not there and also kind of a protective barrier from the outside world. I¡¯ve been through awful things so it¡¯s bound to mess me up, to put it lightly. Anxious perhaps (!), developed my odd habits which is aforementioned above.
       9
       I was 15 yrs old when Typhoon Yolanda came. I thought it would just be a strong typhoon, like   the one that struck our hometown, so we just laid there ready to sleep off the night. But then the wind started to just get stronger and stronger and my grandmother decided that we must go to her friend¡¯s house because it will be safer there, we got out of the house with the rain and wind hard (5:00 AM) and we didn¡¯t make it to her friend¡¯s house but instead was given shelter to nearer house. I was so worried because my mother (real one) chose to stay at home with her two brothers and it wasn¡¯t a concrete house after all plus there were two tall big trees threatening to fall over the house. I was only thinking if they were alright and if they are already wet and cold and if they have a place to stay because the storm was certain to uproot all the houses there. Fortunately, there was no storm surge at our place (Brgy 95 A Caibaan, Tacloban).
       10
       I was 13 during the onslaught of Typhoon Haiyan. Me, my mother and cousin evacuated to a neighbor¡¯s house in case the trees fell on top of ours because of the wind. None of us expected the flood ? it filled the house in less than 10 minutes, so we moved to the window, broke it and ended up hanging on the edges of the roof because we couldn¡¯t climb on top (the house didn¡¯t have a second floor). My defense mechanisms must¡¯ve kicked in because I ended up laughing through it because a lizard and a mouse that were soaking wet climbed on top of my mom¡¯s head and stop there. None of us could swim, but strangely it never occurred to me that we would all die or maybe I chose to believe we wouldn¡¯t die. In any case, I realized I was more chill or whimsical than I thought. I don¡¯t think it is how you¡¯d typically react in that kind of situation but it's better than panicking. And I used it as a trick since then - to stay calm and take the benefit of the doubt.
       11
       I was 13 when Typhoon Yolanda Visited our home. It was an unexpected event for me and my neighbors that the incoming typhoon will be a mild typhoon. It was then said that Typhoon Haiyan was not a super typhoon so my parents did not prepare too much. The day before the typhoon struck the Philippines, it was very sunny and the sky was very bright. But on 6 o¡¯clock in the morning of November 8, the strong whizzing of the wind woke me up. I got up and saw my family covering the windows to prevent the air/wind from coming in. The sound of the wind was very frightening. At one point it started to get silent but it suddenly got louder and the wind was very strong to the point that the only thing that prevents the home to be protected was our main door. Our pet dog was stuck in the second floor and we can hear him from below. My family were those with me in the house when it happened. Once the wind started to calm down, we tried to rescue our dog and thankfully, he was safe. After the event, it also flooded our neighborhood. The water was knee length. We went out and saw that some of the houses had no roofs and walls. The strong wind was very frightening. I now realize(d) that we should always be prepared no matter how big or small the event is.
       12
        I was 15 years old when the incident happened. It was the scheduled landfall of Yolanda. We were staying at my grandmother¡¯s house and my father stayed at home to guard the house. When the water from Cancabato Bay started rushing inside my grandmother¡¯s house we tried to salvage the things and brought it upstairs. The water escalated quickly and it made me and my sisters worry for my father¡¯s safety as he was alone at home. I started imagining things that could possibly happen to my father and i got scared of the possibility the he might die. I was also scared of the fact that the water could reach the second floor which would make us climb the roof and eventually swim to a higher building. This stood out because i really felt the extreme need to help and be with my father and at the same time i felt useless because i had no control over the situation. Also, i felt overwhelming fear of the idea that we would all die in the situation and what¡¯s worse is that we weren¡¯t together as a family.
       13
       When the strongest typhoon to ever hit our country, Yolanda, rampaged through Tacloban City, i didn¡¯t realize the effect of the damage caused by this super typhoon. We live near the equator and we are located by the Pacific Ocean. It was normal to for us to have typhoons. I was 13 years old when this catastrophic event happened. My family and I were in the safe part of the city because it was near the mountains and was quite far from the shoreline.I remember being slightly scared from the noise of the wind and feeling restless.
       14
       I was 19 years old. Our dog suddenly died one morning and i think that i may be the reason as to why she did. Because i put some ointment that my mom bought to try and treat the stain issues our dog was having. But every time i applied the ointment, she would lick the cream off her skin. A few days later when i was still asleep at home, she died while my mother was carrying her. I thought to myself that this was all my fault and that i should have been more careful with what i do and that i should do better at taking care of her. It made me feel so sad to the point that i wish that i was the one who had just experienced it and at some point, it may still have been treated by doctors. This stands out the most because i was directly involved and what i had done may have been the reason as to why these things happened. I think this says much how vulnerable i am when people close to me die. I think this has made me learn a  lesson.
       15
       I was 20 years old. Our activity for National Service Training Program-Medics was to undergo a road hike. Everything was fine until suddenly, a car recklessly went to the other lane (where we were staying) and caused the death of one of the cadet officers. We were headed to Tolosa. shocked, sad and all the negative emotions one can think of. It was my first time to experience such accident and i knew that it could have been me. Some people also blamed us for his death since we were the ones (medics) who rescued the victims before the ambulance came.
   18
       I was 14 years old at that time, still in high school and i was living with my grandparents away from my parents. When Yolanda hit Leyte, i was in Jaro with my grandparents and I was very much worried about my family in Albuera because our house is just in front of the sea. When Typhoon Yolanda came, the water keeps on going/flooding inside the house (the house was built on a low land) when we decided to evacuate, i opened the door and couldn¡¯t clearly see what¡¯s happening outside and which way to go and i could say it's already in state of zero visibility, also even if we pushed to evacuate we couldn¡¯t go out since there were logs and roofings outside. I just told my grandparents to stay at the topmost part of the cabinet near our ceiling while I'm trying to trap and sweep away the water. During the typhoon, i tied my best not to cry so that my grandparents won¡¯t worry so much, i just hide my feelings deep. I couldn¡¯t resist thinking of my family in Albuera  , and i thought we wouldn¡¯t see each other again. 
       19
       I was 14 years old when typhoon Yolanda happened. We live near the sea so we had to evacuate to the house of my grandmother which is located in the town proper. All i can remember is on the day of the typhoon there were heavy rains and very strong winds. The wind sounded like whistling and the roof of the house we stayed in almost got carried away by the strong winds and the trees started to fall down. I was with my family the whole time praying the rosary. I was really afraid because it was my first time to experience such heavy rains and very strong winds. This experience really taught us to be more cautious and always be prepared in times of emergency. It played a big role because in my life because every time a typhoon is approaching we are always alert and we evacuate immediately. 
       20
       After Yolanda, we went to Manila, i stayed at a high school sponsored free education for those hit by the super typhoon. We made friends there and we were staying at the school¡¯s dorm union which was co-ed. We seated at the beds, i was beside my friend (girl) and we snuggled together. One boy that i was texting with at that time knew about it and went to the dorms as well. He was intoxicated. He sat next to me and at first it was okay. One of my friends turned the lights off. The room consisted of almost 10 people. 1 boy and 9 girls. I was seated at the edge with the guy. It was cold, we all shared blankets but only up to our legs. He held my hand and i admit it was romantic and then it started. He started tickling me and i thought it was just a game, then i noticed he started feeling me up from my leg then reaching higher. It felt wrong, so i made him stop and he did and seconds later he was touching my side boob (breast) and i froze, i was thinking to myself what the hell is he doing. I texted my other friend while making sure that my arm was pressed to my sides to avoid him from touching my boob. This experience traumatized me making me really paranoid of all the boys that i meet and even strangers i get seated within public transportation. The experience made me less trusting to men and makes me feel bad about myself for letting it happen.
   21
   I was 14 years old when it happened. We were told that a super typhoon will be making its landfall the day after a very sunny day. Since it was very sunny, only few took it seriously. Thus, making me and the rest of my family in Ormoc City unprepared. I had never been so scared that time and though I was shaking, we were praying and praying. I did my best to remain calm but none of it worked due to the noise brought by the strong winds. And I remember that my grandmother was staying in their old house and my uncles were rushing to get her out of the house before the 2nd floor collapsed. After that experience, it made me value my family more than anything. Mostly, before I came up with a decision, I would think of its betterment for my family before I choose.
   22
   I was 21 years old when I met my boyfriend.  As months went by, he would often get into accidents no matter how small or big it is. He would be injured.  He would collapse because of exhaustion and he almost died from a motorcycle accident. Two weeks ago, being away from him doesn¡¯t help at all and he has no family members close to him that can take care of him. I always get extremely worried because he is always alone most of the time. It¡¯s stressful hearing about what happens to him and not being able to do anything at all. Because of this, I realized that I worried a lot so easily.  Hearing about his accidents gave me the most stress from anything imaginable which is why I think this stands out the most. This doesn¡¯t play anything in my past but it actively keeps me alert and shaky in the present and in the future.
   23
   I was about 16 years old. We were told to evacuate to a nearby building, so we did. We evacuated on the night before Yolanda struck. While in the building, we saw a truck just outside that shoveled everything else from view, the wind blew loud, windows were shattered, and the entrance door was about to be blown over. I was thinking about my family and I was thinking about what I need to do to keep them safe. I felt scared and alert at the same time. This experienced stood out because I vividly remember the river of water that I saw outside of our chapel gate everywhere I see a flood. I remembered the dead corpses. After that experienced I learned that the family is the most valuable thing or people can ever have. I also learned to alleviate other people¡¯s pain by helping them. I learned that I can be strong for other people. The experienced taught me that we can learned from our harsh experiences and build on them.
   24
   I was probably 6 or 7, my parents recently separated at that time so we had to live with my grandmother and a cousin of mine. I remembered calling my cousin for lunch, so I went to his mom, he let me in and told me to remove my shirt and underwear. He then let me lie down on his bed and he bent down on me, to put it lightly, I remembered him asking me if I felt good. I didn¡¯t and it frustrates me that I wasn¡¯t able to do anything to stop it from happening. My cousin was a high school student at that time. This stands out the most for me because I still can¡¯t move on from what happened even after 13 years. I don¡¯t really let it go to me and let it affect how I perceive men in general. I just despise that cousin of mine who, even today, still has the audacity to pull of jokes towards me probably knowing that I still remember what he did to me.
   25
   I am 15 years old when super typhoon Haiyan hit our place. We actually did not expect that it will be that worst.  Around 2am, I was awaken when my mom shouted that our roof is beginning to be destroyed and our tricycle is nowhere to be found. The eye of the super typhoon was in Guiuan just a few kilometers away from Salcedo where we live. It was on November 8, 2013. All ¡°Estehanons¡± were involved. I was so afraid at that time, up to the point that I thought it will be the end of the world. I was just thinking that after a few hours the typhoon will end. My family is praying that time. What made me think that this experienced stands out the most is the fact that it harmed us. Nonetheless, this experienced signifies our resiliency. We have no one to lean on that time aside from God. I think this past experienced made me become more prepared at any time it will happen to me/us again.
   26
   I was 18 years old when a strong earthquake hit Ormoc City on July 6, 2017 at exactly 4:06 pm. It was a regular class day and at that time we were waiting for our instructor to come but even before our instructor came, the earthquake already happened. As we were running towards a high place, I¡¯m with my classmates by the way, I was feeling so afraid thinking that that day could be my last. This experienced stood out the most for me because it really caused great fear and I was even admitted in a hospital thrice after that and I really think that it was because of trauma. That experienced has taught me to be always good in order to be prepared for my death someday and somehow do not regret living my life the way I have lived it.
   27
   Young as I am but I have already went through a lot of adversities and predicaments in my life. I overcame all of them because of wise decision making and through the help of the people around me. I chose super typhoon Yolanda as my most traumatic event because it is a natural disaster, which means that there would be no time/little time given for any decision-making and everyone around me was affected as well. In short, this event in my life was out of anyone¡¯s control and it was truly terrifying.  But looking on the brighter side, this experienced has taught me to be always hopeful and optimistic in life no matter how hard it is. This experience has taught me to always look for the silver lining in every situation that no matter how unfortunate an event may seem, there would always be something good and beautiful that will come out of it. 
   28
   I was 18 years old when the aforementioned event happened. Even before I formally started studying in UP, I am disturbed by the thought if our family can fully support me in my study. And the moment I entered the school I began to feel some pressure because my extended family is doing also their best to support me.  I am anxious that I may commit a mistake or I may fail and disappoint all of them. This particular experience stands out the most because it takes a long effect to my well-being. Based on my experience, I guess I am a person who over thinks a lot about my future and is afraid of making others disappointed. It serves as a lesson and maybe through these experience, I might become a better version of myself.
   29
   I was around 12. The water from the ocean made its way to our subdivision and into our homes. My grandma almost got washed away, thankfully she held onto our doorknob before my dad got her to safety. She had dislocated her right arm after that. This happened around morning. I was worried and feeling helpless. I think it stood out since it affected my family immensely, after the storm. It probably just makes me as another statistic. It allows me to be more practical in terms of the way I live.
   30
   I was around 14 years old when my mother started dating a guy from work but the stressful experience happened when I was already 16 years old. My mom assumed her ex started using drugs and that he was threatening to kill her and himself if ever my mom wants to break-up. It happened around 2015-2016, 10th grade in Ormoc City and it involved my mom, her ex, my brother, his 2 nannies, me, and even my grandparents. (Since they were the one who had to get us out from the City when the worst case scenario happened) We had to stay at the police station for our safety and we were recommended to move out of town because the guy was really getting violent. There were times I got home from school where the apartment is a mess. The worst was when it was around 3 am and they were screaming at the other room and my mother was hysterically crying. Personally, this was worse than Yolanda because our family¡¯s life was at stake, we had to move to Manila to stay away.  This will forever be a reminder to not trust other people¡¯s motives because anyone could be crazy.
   31
   I was 15 when that happened. The typhoon almost leveled our home. Fortunately no one died among my family but the level of anxiety it all gave us was unmatched, it was a life or death situation. I was severely anxious that cause I haven¡¯t experienced that intensity of a storm before my entire life. I was just waiting and we were helpless. Surviving the strongest typhoon in recent history is nothing to be proud of honesty. It could have been prevented if all of us took good care of our planet. It was a wakeup call for millions, I being a part of it, that things could¡¯ve have gone differently if we weren¡¯t so cruel to our environment. I¡¯m still somewhat thankful to have experienced and survived Haiyan for it helped me build who I am today. 
   32
   I was 18 years old when that event happened. I was walking back to our house when suddenly a drunk person came to block my way and held my arm. It was around January when that event happened, past 21:00. I couldn¡¯t ask for help that time from anyone since I was alone and there were no houses around, they¡¯re 100 meters away from me where I was. I was a bit scared that time and I lost my confidence. Although I know some self-defense techniques, I came to lose my energy to do so because I was almost trembling. I think this particular experienced stands the most because it only involved me and the attacker. To add to that he is really tall and muscular with which I find I had to protect myself. This experienced really told me that no matter how confident and brave I think I am, I shrink when reality hit me. That experience taught me to be careful and alert every time since we don¡¯t know when will such thing/event happen again.
   33
   I was 10 years old when we crashed. We were on our way to the mall to buy a new pair of shoes. Suddenly, a dog came out of nowhere and tried to cross the street but our motorcycle hit the dog and we crashed. It was a Sunday and I was with my parents. I did not know what to do after we crashed, I was just lying on the street not knowing what happened to my parents. After a while, an ambulance came and brought us to the hospital. That¡¯s when I knew my father was in a severe condition that he wasn¡¯t able to work for almost 6 months. I think that this stands out the most because even months after the incident, I still blame myself for what happened. If not for that new pair of shoes, we won¡¯t be going to the mall that day, was all I was thinking.
   34
   I was about 15 years old and I didn¡¯t really feel scared about hearing about the super typhoon because I¡¯ve already experienced a lot of storms and our area is a flood-prone subdivision. We were just eating breakfast and you can hear the howling of the wind and tap on the window from leaves that would be blown from the trees. First, the food rose at faster rate than normal rate but it only leveled up to my waist which is usually how high the flood gets. But then the roof started to move as if the house was breathing and we were surprised to see that it was already dripping inside only to find out that the steel roof had already been blown away. I witnessed as my brother tried to save his drawing desk while the roof of his room was completely blown away and I was bonded by the light from the sky.  After all the strong winds and rain have subsided, we evacuated from our house to our neighbor¡¯s and we were forced to see the remains of our humble home. I felt that that was the end of our lives but what bothered me most was how we were going to rise from this disaster. Then the nights came where we¡¯d get little to no sleep because of the alarm system of our neighbor which would go off more than 3 times from false alarms. This experienced stood out because there were multiple casualties.
   36
   I was 15 years old when I had experienced this event. We lived in Barnesville Fatima Village, Tacloban City. Our barangay has always been prone to floods especially because of our sewage problem. We were all aware of the news about a super typhoon that would hit our place so we prepared and bought canned goods, noodles, batteries, etc. and placed our things to higher ground. But not long after, we noticed that the winds blew stronger and the glasses on our windows were shattered into pieces. We tried evacuating to our cousin¡¯s house not far from us but moments later, rushing water was entering the household and I have noticed how the furniture¡¯s were floating everywhere. We all tried to get out apparently the door got stuck because the water outside the house prevented us to push through. Luckily, my father and my 3 brothers, helped smash and break the door, enabling us to swim outside. At that moment, I was panicking. Because I knew I couldn¡¯t    swim and the water was almost above my neck. I didn¡¯t know what to do. I was just standing there, looking at my cousins trying to find a way out.  As soon as possible they decided for us to go to an elevated area. They lead the way out and kept calling my name and keeping an eye on our baby cousin who was crying in fear. Then I got stuck on a chair, a wooden heavy chair. They tried pulling me out while I was bursting in tears. We eventually swam across the rapid flowing water we couldn't cross over because of the current, so we had to hold on to an electric wire and hoped for the best. Eventually, we made it to safety but people who evacuated in the same place we did, kept all crying cause their others relatives has been washed out and they didn¡¯t  know where he/she have gone. This particular event scarred me for life since my mother was in Samar and we didn¡¯t know if she was still alive or injured. Remembering this event makes me depressed since I have seen dead people away from me and my own life flashing in my eyes, believing that was my end. 
   37
   I was 13 years old when super typhoon Yolanda struck Eastern Visayas Region on November 7, 2013. I don¡¯t know exactly when it first struck us but I just woke up when I felt a drop of water fall on my face and when I woke up, people were already running around our house trying to salvage what they can.  I felt confused and scared because I wasn¡¯t really aware of what was going on, all I know is that the water was already flooding the area and a part of our roof was already gone, so we have to do everything to save our lives from that moment on. The aftermath of that disaster was even worse, when there was no food anymore to feed our hunger, we had to go to greatest   lengths just to put foods on the table. I think that Yolanda made me a stronger person, I may have been a confident child back then but after Yolanda I learned that your life or survival rather depends on you. You should learn to be independent and not depend on others. 
   38
   It was the 26th of October 2018. I was in my room, refreshed as I have just finished taking a shower. I have not yet changed into my clothes. I was lying on my bed, going over my report outline. A towel was plastered on my body. I looked up and saw a phone with its camera facing me. The phone was placed on the upper edge of the wall. The phone belonged to my mother¡¯s partner. We were the only persons in the house. I saw his fingers moving the phone, probably to get a better view. I stood up, locked the door and wore pants.  I was scared, my heart was beating like a drum. I was shaking uncontrollably. I tried my best to act normally. I didn¡¯t want him to know. I was 18 years old. 
   41
   Two weeks ago after a tiring day at school, me and my friends are having dinner late at night and decided to go home around 11 pm. As I read the messages in one of my group chats in Facebook messenger, I accidentally watched a horrifying video of a man being beheaded by a terrorist. The man was hopelessly crying while he was forced to be on his knees while the other terrorist are cheering. Then, the sort of leader of the group suddenly beheaded the man and the crowd shouted so loud. It happened so fast and I was so shocked by the video. I felt horrible that time like I wanted to puke anytime. I hate seeing that video again and left the group chat. I think this experience stands out the most because this was my very first time to watch videos like this and I never thought I will feel that way. Terrorism is such a major problem nowadays! 
   43
   I was 17 when it happened. I and a friend rode on a Kayak which capsized while we were on some rapids somewhere in Basey. I had to cling to a rock near the side of the river to not get swept away by the current. I saw my friend get dragged through the water and lost sight of him. It was hard to get away as the current was too strong. I felt genuine horror and was scared that I would remain stuck sitting on the rock looking back, that experience taught me to not take things lightly and always think everything through. Nowadays I don¡¯t think back to the event much as I¡¯ve matured and moved on. Today, whenever I bring it up to my friend, we both laugh at the event as if it was a fond memory, which to us, it was.

   I was 16 years old when I was about to go home late for CAT Practice at someone¡¯s house. I was unaware that my aunt (who was my guardian) was going to check on me at school, and she was angry when she found out I was not there. When we both got home, she was really angry at me when I went home late again and I did not inform her where I was. All that anger went to hitting me and blaming me and my relationship with someone. I was very scared because we knew she was like this to my cousins but it¡¯s her first time to me. This stands out because it was my very first time experience such a physical ¡°disciplinary action¡± and I definitely fear to disobey her or anyone else. 
   45
   I was 14/15 years old when my father started showing signs of dementia. It was hard growing up and seeing my father act like a kid. I was in Science High School, he started peeing and pooping on his bed. I witnessed how my mom would bath him. I felt ashamed of having a father like him so whenever my classmates visited my house I wouldn¡¯t let them in. My brother was in Jeddah that time so there was no guy to help us take care him. When he got bedridden, I was always mad about helping my mom dress his wounds. I thought that he was a burden to us but whenever mom tells me that we need to take care of him because he devoted his life providing for us, only then would I felt at ease. My father died in July 16, 2017, the day after my brother arrived home from Jeddah with his family. It was a painful experience for us because we were planning to spend a good time together because finally, we¡¯re complete. But really, it was his time to go. I am clearly remember how my mother cried so hard because it was hard for her to accept the fact that his partner for 37 years is gone. The experience was painful, really painful for me but I really appreciate my friends¡¯ sympathy, especially my brothers and sisters in the ¡°Youth for Christ¡± community who showered me with prayers and offered service for several nights. The only thing I think about to make me feel at ease is that finally, my father suffering has ended. 
   47
   Everything began on the night of the 7th of November 2013. My parents decided to stay at home with our family¡¯s youngest sibling. I am the eldest child and I was 14 years old and an 8th grader at that time. We live in Purok 5, Poblacion Guiuan Eastern Samar, neighboring our grandmother¡¯s house. When my parents made the decision to stay, I and my three other siblings were transferred to our grandmother¡¯s house. When the winds began to pick up strength; my aunt and I decided for all of us to transfer to another neighbor¡¯s house thinking it was safer. We were all huddled together in this house¡¯s kitchen, my grandmother reciting the rosary. As the eldest child and son, I was so worried about my parents and younger sibling. It was already early morning and the winds and rain were at their cruelest and most violent stage. We all struggled to the house¡¯s master bedroom. But when we reached there the fallen ceiling as shield from the shards of glass from the windows and the flying debris from outside. We were virtually trapped inside the bedroom. My experience with typhoon Haiyan left an indelible mark in my heart and mind. With the typhoon, I realized how important faith in God is and the fleeting nature of human life. With these, I learned to value my family and friends more and to be contented with what we have. It also made me resolute in achieving my dream to be a meteorologist, serving the community 24/7. 
   48
   I was 17 years old when my grandpa and uncle argued related to family issues. This happened in their residence. I felt upset, mad and sad these people can¡¯t properly manage their emotions in the sense that they¡¯ve lost the sense of respect to each other. I really love my grandpa because he has a good moral and a good principle in life, he was one of the best life teachers I had. It makes me really sad to know that he¡¯s gone after just a small argument on a small problem. Sometimes I blame myself that I wasn¡¯t able to fully serve him in the hospital and even gave more time when he was here. The role of this experience for my past present and future is that this will serve for me as a lesson on the importance of containing and the right way of expressing one¡¯s emotions. 
   49
   I was 13 nearing 14 then.  I and my family were staying at our grandparent¡¯s house since we were expecting the floods to occur in our other house. Unfortunately, we were safer than we had stayed at home since the storm surge hit the vicinity. Our barangay, being quite near to the coastline I felt very anxious. Thinking if this was how we were all going to die. In hindsight, had we not been there that day my relatives would have perished along with other families without the guidance of my father. He stands out as it is the closest time I¡¯ve near death. Had I known how to swim I might have had an edge, but I could never say. I see it as a wake-up call now to always have pre-emptive measures at hand ? to never be complacent. 
   50
   I was 6 years old when the stressful event happened. It happened at home before noon during school day. I was with my house helper when it happened. I was watching cartoons when she came to me and asked if we could play a game but it had to be a secret. She started to undress me and herself. She started to touch me inappropriately and she started to kiss me. I did not know how to feel at that time but I knew I did not want to do it. I don¡¯t remember how long it lasted for. This stands out the most because things around me constantly remind me of the event and my family or friends does not know about it. I want to think this experience does not tell me who I am. I want to think that this experience should have nothing to do with my past present or future.  
   51
   November 8, 2013, Tacloban City. I was 15 years old when it happened. I woke up at nearly 4 a.m. out of the strong wind that was already starting to blow hard. Later on around 6 am I told my mom it sounds like there are waves ? which she replied that¡¯s how a powerful typhoon really sounds like. We were moving and keeping our stuff because our floor started to get flooded ? which was weird because it never floods in our area no matter how hard it rained. Even our Christmas tree fell down. We couldn¡¯t see what was going on outside because my dad covered the windows with ¡°trapal¡± (thick water-proof sheet) so we were assuming only of rainwater flood. The scary part started when my mother wanted to get the pump so she could inflate the floaties; she complained but it was hard to open the door. When she did open the door, we were shocked to see above door knob level water coming in. This made the flood instantly and quickly filled the house and knocked off the furniture. My father instructed us all to go outside so as to rise getting trapped. It was especially terrifying because what was happening was something that I only see on TV and I never imagined that it could really happen to me. I really thought I was going to die. I thought my entire family was going to die too. What made the thoughts worse was that my father was ready to prepare the ropes so we can tie us all together to the mango tree in front of our house so that ¡°if we die, at least well be found altogether¡± thinking about still feels really morbid ? the thought that my father was already thinking about keeping his families corpses in one place. That¡¯s the part that really lingers until now. 
   52
   I was 6 years old when my mother and father decided to be separated. Ever since, I usually witnessed a couple of fights between the two of them. Our hometown was at Las Pi?as City and after being separated my mother together with my four siblings decided to start a new life in Calbayog City. My father was left in Las Pi?as all alone. I wanted to be with my father. It is because I¡¯m a daddy¡¯s girl. Seven years had passed with no communication or news about my father I¡¯ve never heard about him. Until one day someone sent me a message that he¡¯s dying. I went to Las Pi?as and to my surprise he was not able to recognize me anymore. I was little kid since then and I went back as grown-up one. I encouraged him to get treated. I felt guilty. I should have stayed with him. If I just stayed, it would not happen. It was November 2013 when Yolanda happened. My sister was staying in Samar and that time my father was in the hospital. I felt worse see my father crying and worried about my sister in Samar. 
   53
   I was just 14 years old when typhoon Yolanda hit the most parts of Eastern Visayas. It was very traumatic for almost all of the affected victims because it was something that we never expect to happen. That happened five years ago in November 2013 and really, our family was able to experience a lot of troubles during and after that disaster. Our house was not that strong enough to fight against the strong winds and so we needed to evacuate. We lost our home and I think that was something that really made us depressed. I couldn¡¯t actually accept that everything was gone from us in just a few hours. I felt empty during that time yet I was still thankful because all of my family members were safe and not injured. I could say that the typhoon Yolanda was the worst experience. I had as of now yet it was an event which made me stronger, which made my family closer to God. The experience may be very difficult to handle nevertheless it brought lessons I will never forget. That disaster reminds me that I am a survivor and I will always be. 
   54
   I was 13 years old turning 14 the day after typhoon Yolanda struck. I was back at our house in Guiuan with my family. We stayed at the second floor of our house due to the storm surge alert but around 2-3 AM, the ceilings of our house were already unstable and it felt like the second floor of our house was being shaken due to the extremely strong winds so we had to go down to the first floor and stay at my parents room. I then had to go to the toilet while the winds continued to whistle and wreck our home and a few seconds after I got out of the toilet, the ceilings in there fell and the glass on the door shattered. I was really terrified along with my family and all I was thinking during that time was ¡°when will this typhoon end?¡± this stood out most because not a single experience has had the same traumatic effect on me as this. Form this experience, I learned to always be alert, prepared all the time, and not let my emotions take over in times of dire need in order to be functional. 
   55
   Yolanda happened when I was 14 years old. But I also experienced a stressful difficulties months ago. So basically I was 18 years old. Yolanda was really devastated because my parents¡¯ house was destroyed. I think, almost everything was destroyed in Brgy. Rawis, Dulag, Leyte. I saw how Yolanda destroyed that homes, family and even their hopes. Foods was limited and everyone were hungry. And I feel so pity and sad. I sympathized my family and relatives of what they experienced. That experience made me realized to spend and treasure every moment with your loved ones because we will never knew when they will be away from us. What happened months ago leave a marked on, my friends really took a yell on me. My friends were stabbing me to make and it turned me to be the person I am, less bubbly and do not trust easily. 
   56
   There were two Traumatic events that I have experienced. The first one was typhoon Yolanda ravaging our city. It was really scary because the flood under their house and we need to get on because we might die if we will not because the water is flowing in rapidly.  Aftermath, when we don¡¯t have electricity, food, safe shelter. Next, entering college the last 3 convention months was really hard for me. I regretted why did I do it and I feel sad to myself. Going back on typhoon Haiyan, I was 12 years old when it happened. I almost died because I can¡¯t feel the floor outside of our house because we went to our neighbor¡¯s house. 
   58
   I was only about eight years old when this happened. My parents got into a fight and my mother threatened to leave. As a child, of course I was really scared. I think this was my most Traumatic experience since I can¡¯t imagine living in a broken family. 
   59
   I was inside the Maritime Academy, when the traumatic event happened. I was 18 years old during that time. The training inside the Academy is so intense that you don¡¯t really have time for yourself to rest. We run, do push-ups, squats, and other physical exercises from morning until evening. In addition to that, we get screamed at for every mistake we do and we get reprimanded because of it. These experiences were quite okay for me. What triggered my emotions was that they were trying to put in our minds that we should not quit because the salary after all is worth it. It triggered me because I entered the Academy because I like the name of the job. Not because of the high salary, everybody was thinking about money, even my senior cadets. Because of it, I resigned. I was scared to be like them (greedy). This experienced stands out the most for I believed that because of quitting, my dream of becoming a seafarer is starting to fade, it feels like my future is at risk. And I think to myself that I am a weak person. 
   60
   During the super typhoon Yolanda, I was 13 years old and I was with my family. I did not know that the typhoon had caused many lives because there was no electricity. After the typhoon, I was surprised and I was worried about my friends because they might be dead. But I was relieved that all of them were safe. This experience play in important role in my life because it will serve as a lesson and a precautionary measure on what to do next time when. It helps me to become aware of my environment because I do believe that it is the cause of the natural calamities happening in this world. 
   61
   I was 18 years old freshman when I joined an organization (club). There I met my friends. They were 3-4 years older than me. We became so close that we would have sleepovers. I always looked up to them, since they treated me so good. And though there was that one friend I was really so close then that I didn't ever think would really do such thing.  It happened one night in a sleepover where our group slept on the mattress. It was late then, I woke up having a morning mood, only to find out that a hand was already crawling from my stomach headed inside my undies. He held my genitals. It took him almost 30 minutes. He only stopped when someone woke up and went to the bathroom. After my friend went out the bathroom, he went in. I took that chance to sleep facing downwards, so that he would not touch me again. Back then I always thought why I didn¡¯t do anything, like stopping him. But then, I guessed my mind was still processing, that such thing had happened.  The next time we met, I ignored him and my friends. Until one day I snapped and told everyone what happened. First, I told my closest friends then my ¡°org¡± mates. I wanted him to die, I wanted him not to go to school, don¡¯t ever show his face in school or else I will fucking hurt him real bad or I want him to go to jail and so on and so forth. Normally, there were others who did not believe in me, saying that he will never do it. But most did believe me, actually we had same field those who are on his side. And now, he transferred to Cebu and never showed his face in school, knowing that he is pretty much broken. 
   62
   It was 8th of November in the year 2013 when Yolanda struck the eastern seaboard of the archipelago particularly in Samar and Leyte. Personally, it felt like it was the end of everything especially when the strong with wind crashing down our house. It was totally destroyed after the typhoon. Thus, after that traumatic experience we get our hopes vanished. But with strong faith in God we survive the disaster and eventually live a happier life carrying with us the lessons from the typhoon. 
   63
   The incident that had happened stands out the most since it was just recent. Due to the multiple things we do at home, that time was not an exemption where our helper did another task while cooking. During the fire, I was thinking about the proper way to put off the fire, while our helper was doing what she needs to do to stop it, as well. When she got the chance, she turned it off and the fire was immediately put out as well. 
   64
   I was 12 years old. They fought and then one of them started not going home. It was got kind of complicated because until now they still not in good terms. Every time they see each other, they end up fighting. The other side of the family was not much of a help. It happened in the house, when we went to a psychiatrist and there it was revealed that nothing will go back to what it was before. I felt sad and I don¡¯t know what I am going to feel right now. I have a feeling that nothing is right from the start. I still cry whenever this topic is opened up. It stands out the most because until now, I am hurt. It made me look the world or situations around me different. I am doing my best now in order to move on from this event and encouraging my mom and siblings to be strong for their future. 
   65
   I was only 14 years old at that time. On the day when Yolanda was to make its landfall, I expected it to bring heavy rains since it was said on the news that it was a strong typhoon. But it didn¡¯t Earlier that day, around 6 or 7 AM the weather seemed so calm. The sun was shining brightly, and the sky was not even cloudy. I heard some people say that HOPE must have made a mistake on their forecast. It was such an unlikely phenomenon. And then later that day, the skies began to turn grey and the wind blew stronger. It happened so swiftly, I looked out the window and saw houses being torn into pieces by the gushing wind. And then, everything vanished, and all I saw white covered the horizon. I heard banging sands from upstairs and water began to enter our home. I thought our house would collapse, but thank God it didn¡¯t. I was really worried the ceiling would fall down on us. We hid under the staircase since my mom thinks it was the safest and most stable part of our house that could withstand the debris in case our ceiling breaks. 
   66
   I was 10 years old when I experience this trauma. A situation when my parents are fighting in front of us - my siblings.  They had this fight when it involves physical violence. I remember when my father was choking my mother and there is me trying to let go my father while his choking my mother. My father also tried to punch mother and when I tell him to stop he grabbed me and try to punch me also. But my mother fight back he threw some things to my father and suddenly the eyebrows of my father bleeds and the worst part that I have heard is when they want to separate and let us decide where we want to go. This experience is my unforgettable family-related problem because it made me realized that in order to have a strong family relationship honesty and faithfulness to your partner is the key. 
   67
   I was 13 years old when super typhoon Yolanda hit Guiuan, my hometown. My uncle and grandfather stayed at home to look after the house and the pump boat. While me, mother, sister, aunt, cousin and 2 years old baby checked-in at a hotel. At first we felt afraid even though everything would be okay after the landfall. However, when the typhoon hit the windows we couldn¡¯t open the door because the pressure inside the room was strong due to the strong winds coming from the windows. . We couldn't breathe properly and debris started being blown inside the room through the window. This particular experience stands out because of the fear we felt diving the typhoon. We were all females in the room and my father was away at his work which made us worry even more. In the aftermath, we saw dead bodies and people crying out for help but no one was able to help. The experience changed my perspective about life and how things can change in an instant as well as the value of family. It helped build resilience from our family and the people in the town. Slowly, we learned to accept what happened as a challenge to our faith and strengthen as individuals.  
   68
   I was 14 years old when typhoon Yolanda struck Leyte. I was in our house in Brgy. Caen-Unlag, Ormoc City, together with my mother and cousin. . At first we were complacent that nothing bad would happen, so we didn¡¯t prepare as much as we should have. That was one of the most important lessons that we learned in our life, but we learned it the hard way. Good thing our house was sturdy, but what¡¯s traumatizing is the sound of the wind and the debris that comes along with it, and the short screams of our neighbors as they knocked at our gate. Also, I starting crying when the flood entered our house and some of our roofs were fallen away.  I was so scared at that time, but praying to God calmed me amidst the storm. The typhoon taught my family and I the important lessons in life such as being prepared, being faithful to God and to be a helping hand to others in times of need. 
   69
   I was 14 years old when the super typhoon struck Eastern Visayas.  It was 6 o¡¯clock in the morning when we decided to evacuate to our Brgy. Hall. I was shocked because of what I have seen. Trees were uprooted, houses were destroyed and some people were leaving their home seeking for an evacuation center. Thankfully, we crossed safely. About 9 o¡¯clock in the morning when someone knocked the door of the Brgy. Hall, a boy seeking for help for her mother. At that time the wind and the rain were very strong that when you see outside no visible things could be seen.  The people there helped the boy to save her mother, thankfully they did.  We were trapped on the building thinking that this could be the last day of our lives. No hopes and dreams could be seen on the eyes of people. The wind was very strong that all of the windows of the building had been destroyed and also the door. At that time praying is the strongest weapon I¡¯ve used. I felt weak because I am cold and there is no things we have saved but only ourselves.  But only ourselves but that was the important thing we could has, ourselves being saved. 
   71
   I was 14 years old when the super typhoon made landfall in Tacloban City. I and my family members was in the kitchen eating breakfast. I was still feeling drowsy just before the storm surge happened and water was quickly rising from ankle depth to waist depth in a few seconds. Relatives from other houses were from frantic trying to get in our house to seek higher ground on the second floor. The waters eventually went past a body length even reaching the 10th step in our 13 steps staircase. At that point everyone was already upstairs. A few other people were rescued and went through the window of the 2nd floor. This experience really stood at because of how abrupt the events where and how frantic the people were.  Also, if we didn¡¯t move as fast in the water while it was waist deep we could have all died. The thought in myself is disturbing. The aftermath was even worse than the actual event. 
   72
   I was 16 years old then. A freshman in the University. It was the enrollment period for the second semester. I was staying at the ladies dormitory. The day before the event, my sister came to pick me up. I said no, so we both stayed at the dormitory. On November 8, 2013 the day started with heavy downpour.  I can remember my sister and I laugh at the flying objects outside. We felt safe, we were fine. It¡¯s just a typhoon. We've dealt with those countless times. As the water came rushing in I searched her.  We were on different room since she isn¡¯t a dormer. She put the things in a small plastic for safety. The water filled half of the dormitory and all the furniture were struck at the end of the hallway. And as the dormitory was filled up with water, my sister and I swam through the furniture over and under we swam until we reach the backdoor. We swam to the water beside the dorm and climbed on to it. Then we jumped to the roof of the dorm. Up until now, I Still felt ashamed, embarrassed to my parents. I felt so sorry for my sister. This trauma would be no-existential. 
   73
   On November 8, 2013, the whole province of Leyte was hit by the strongest and biggest typhoon ever recorded in history of humankind, the super typhoon Yolanda. I was only 13 years old when it all happened.  At that age, I was terrified of what will happen next. I was scared for the safety of my family. I was vulnerable for I can¡¯t do anything to stop it. The aftermath was much more painful. Thousands of innocent lives were taken. For two months, many injured life, without electricity and lack of food and potable water. This particular experience made me discover my Strength and weaknesses. And it will definitely help me succeed from obstacles that will get on my way in the future. 
   74
   It happened last year 2018, I was 19 years old. It was already 10 PM and I was trying to find a good place to study for my exam on the next day. I was with my ex-boyfriend that time and he suggested that we can go to their new house and review my lessons. Since, he has a key and the place is very quiet. So I decided to take the offer. When we arrived at their new home, it was already past 10 pm and their neighborhood were already asleep. The house was so dark until the lights have been turned on. We went to his room and asked if I could use another room for me to focus on reviewing. His response was unaffirmative since he said that the other room are still uncleaned. So I decided to stay in his room because they have no table in the kitchen. When I was about to start studying he start to distract me by kissing and hugging me every now and then.  But then I asked him to get himself something that could divert his attention because it¡¯s really disturbing for me. Until, he said he won¡¯t let me review until I make him ejaculate. It alarmed me, but then he was really serious and tried to stay things that would get my conscience. Next thing, I was submitted him little by little through his words. We didn¡¯t have sex because I¡¯ve realized that I don¡¯t want to have sex with this guy. It happened for two or three more times until I decided to break up with him because I felt like he was only trying me to fill his sexual pleasure. This experience still haunts me up to now. I haven¡¯t forgiven the guy yet because after the experience I feel I am damaged although little by little, I feel becoming whole again. 
   75
   I was 13 years old when the typhoon Yolanda struck our hometown in Tacloban City. Everyone I knew who was in or was residing in our hometown and the nearby towns was greatly affected by the deluge. It was morning on the first of November that I experienced and witnessed the strongest typhoon ever to make landfall destroy and ravage my hometown, leaving thousands dead and injured.  I felt so hopeless and depressed upon seeing the aftermath of the storm. I have never been experienced first-hand scale of destruction, death and suffering up to that moment. I can say, after what has happened, that it provided all of us that were affected a learning experience to never take these things lightly again, and also a renewed strength and resiliency that no matter happens, we will always recover. 
   78
   I was 13 years old when we were living in San Jose during those times. The wind was very strong and our roof was lifted so we transferred to our neighbor¡¯s house in front of us. Then water started rising, we decided to go out of the house and go to our neighbors who had a second floor. We reached there but the water was up to neck high already. We reached the house and went upstairs. Other neighbors were already there too and we all prayed. I was really scared, I thought of accepting death then and there.  I think this memory stands out the most because it was my only near death experience. And then I really felt that there was already no hope. This particular experience made me realize the value of life. 
   79
   Since it was a very bad experience I¡¯ll just say whatever comes first into my mind. I failed my pretest, my teacher gave me another chance. My classmates didn¡¯t like it, they said that I deserve to fail. Some of my classmates believe me because of it.  As I remembered they beat me up and broke my rib because of it. After that, I went home and a classmate of mind snitched on me. My mom got very upset she got her belt and proceeded to whip me for the next hour.  Screaming ¡°You¡¯re worthless, you¡¯re nothing.¡± I didn¡¯t know what I was feeling, I forgot how feelings feel. 
   80
   I was 16 years old when Yolanda hit. My family took refuge in a small bathroom, we were a family of five. Our roof came in, allowing strong winds to rattle the whole house. It felt like an earthquake. We were at my aunt¡¯s house and all of my family was there. I genuinely thought we were all going to die. This experience stands out the most because I feel like it has changed my whole outlook in life it has shaped my personality indefinitely. 
   81
   The typhoon Yolanda devastated Eastern Samar and the adjacent regions on November 8, 2013. It wasn¡¯t supposed to be at my home in the said province when it happened. My school in Cebu expected us to come back from our three weeks¡¯ vacation that was supposed to end on November 6. Since travels are canceled I was stuck at home. I was 13 years old at that time. My family along with 3 others decided to evacuate to a large but still wooden house to sit out. The typhoon barely 8 hours later, the house was violently shaking on. We were forced to retreat to the basement. The upper floors fell down right on top of us with the surrounding coconut trees who fell adding to the weight, nearly crushing all of us. We were shivering at the extreme cold brought by the heavy rain and strong winds.  I was really scared to die back then, as it really seems we all would die. It was unforgettable since it was the only experience that I had considering near-death, and it frightened me the most knowing that I still had a lot to do and change about myself, that made me rethink my choices in life. 
   82
   I was 14 when my parents decided to separate it was after the typhoon Yolanda, we lost our house and everything in it. They had a big fight, but it was already months after that. They fought in front of me and my brother and we just stood there crying. I think it was the biggest plot twist I had become everything changed since then. 
   83
   I was 13 years old at the time. My family on board mates stayed in the house the night before the event. I was worried because of the strong gust of wind. The next day around 5 AM when the fog surrounded the house and wind was getting stronger and stronger.  We witnessed the metal covers flying away from the house and what made the worst was the quick flow of the flood water entering our house which was actually elevated from the ground. During that time, doubts of being alive after the incident came to our minds. The boys went outside and helped us passed the 100-meter water. My younger sister was about to be carried away by the strong current, good thing that I have held her. Along the way, I saw a red snake on the floating foam and I started hitting my feet on the palm tree and I got injured and almost fainted because of the very traumatic experience. It got more than a year for me to recover and start again. 
   84
   I was 9 years old back then when I experienced being harassed. It happened to me at school but certainly, I did not expect that it would happen outside, not aware that this will happened in my home.  It started with small gestures at home by a relative that I didn¡¯t mind because I didn¡¯t want to think of it as anything unusual. I was ever harassed in front of other people by the same relative, I started feeling bad back then, not wanting to associate myself with anything sexual related. At school a classmate being sexually assaulted me by groping my burst painfully. Which then resulted in a fist fight that I initiated a few moments after it started. I also think that I was almost raped while buying materials for a project; there was also this experience when someone inserted something in my back while I was in the midst of the town people enjoying the celebration. All these experience made me feel wary of men to the extent, I have come to hate them. Before I challenged this fear by mingling with my boy friends after 3 years of self-isolation from them.

   I was 14 years old with typhoon Haiyan devastated our province last November 8, 2013. We were scared by my family because of some tendencies that maybe there will be a tsunami, that our house might totally be destroyed and we will no longer have a place to stay during the storm which was very dangerous since there may be flying debris. I feel so scared and nervous since I was overthinking that maybe I will die and will not survive at all. This experience stands out for me the most since this was so far from the worst thing that happened in my entire life. After the storm, it made me a strong person and to be ready whenever there are impeding typhoon that will most likely hit our province. The past was a lesson for me to guide my present and as well as my future.

   When super typhoon Yolanda hit, I was 14 years old. I remember the day before it was targeted to make landfall, our afternoon classes were suspended so that we may go home and prepare ourselves. After being accustomed to typhoons happening, we did not actually prepare.  The next day, my parents woke my brother and me, as the wind started to get stronger and the rain started to get heavier. Our family huddled in the space beneath our stairwell and that was the moment it hit me. My relatives were living at in Tacloban. Where the storm was projected to hit hardest. I began sobbing as I started to feel terrified of what was happening and what was about to happen after. This experience will never be erased from my memories as it taught me that life is indeed impermanent. The event showed me now in one day, everything you have worked hard for and cared for can just be wiped away very easily. This experience made me realize that we can never tell what is about to happen in the future. 
   87
   I was 6 or 7 years old at that time. I couldn¡¯t really exactly remember but I was studying kindergarten at that time. We were already on our way home after shopping in Ormoc city. While we were on the road a girl suddenly crossed the street. The driver of the public van we were in tried to maneuver the van away from the girl so we ended up hitting a huge tree. Unfortunately, the girl was still hit because of the impact from the tree, the van spinning, making other passengers be thrown out of the window/door towards the plain fields and the road. I didn¡¯t witness the actual scene because I was sleeping then. But I woke up because I heard a screeching sound of the car¡¯s brake and a loud crash. When I woke up and went outside, I saw blood and shattered glasses everywhere. The woman sitting beside (my grandma) also died.  As a normal girl, I felt very scared especially when I saw my grandma covered in blood and the other passengers asking for help. This I think is the worst experience for me.

   I was 14 years old at the time the typhoon Ruby happened and the part of our house was destroyed specifically our kitchen and dining area. It was back in our hometown at Maydolong, Eastern Samar on December 2014. My whole family was deeply affected by the scenario I felt extreme fear and anger at the typhoon and what I felt as an underserved circumstance brought to our family. I think the scenario stands out the most because we were at that time, suffering from monetary crisis and after the event, it felt like we hit rock bottom. However, the experience taught me to stay strong and that there are external factors that we have no control of. The event would always be a reminder that there are inevitable things that happened. So it¡¯s up to us to rise up and this would remind me now and in the future.

   I was four years old. My father was drunk and has been throwing violent tantrums around the house. My mother was badly bruised and wounded while I was crying in the corner of the room. I was scared that one of them might kill the other but I was too scared to move because my father has hit me several times before. As a result, I became very anxious whenever I see drunk people and I get panic. I also get drunk occasionally so that this exposure towards people getting drunk made my panic attack disappear.  
   91
   I was 20 years old when it occurred. We were drinking in the house my friend as it was the fiesta of Tacloban. I passed out early on in the evening as we started the party early in the afternoon. My friends continued to drink while I was in the living room sleeping. I completely felt safe not knowing what would occur to me in the next few hours. That¡¯s why I just slept, thinking it would be a normal drinking session. When I was regaining consciousness I felt a hand inside my underwear stroking my private area. I have no idea what I should do at that time. The best thing that I came up with was to pretend to wake up letting my asshole to think that I was still unconscious so he would remove his hands, and he did. He was a trusted yet the notorious senior of mine who like to drink and be a complete rascal at parties. His notoriety came from the stories of my friends who told about is harassment to other people I knew as well. I knew that he was that kind of person before but my friends were there so I thought it would be okay.

   I was 19 when I found out that my partner of more than a year was cheating on me with a girl he met online. After the incident, I had constant thoughts of being an inadequate person, and for many nights I struggle with my self-confidence I have trouble sharing this particular incident with my friends because I think that this amounts to nothing against their own concerns. This incident, by far, is the most traumatic for me because of the extreme emotional damage it caused. Because of the incident, I now have trouble trusting people around me including friends and family. 
   94
   I was 14 years old when typhoon Ruby hit my province. We evacuated at my aunt¡¯s house because our house is just a Bungalow. I was stressed that time since I also got in a motorcycle accident days before the typhoon. The event sometimes haunts me. 
   96
   I was only 16 years old when the experience happened. I watched how our house was destroyed by the storm and how the place was filled up with water. I panicked and I feel paranoid at the time. When the storm was over we have nothing to eat and there was a tsunami alert that night. I was crying so hard, I cannot breathe. It took me a long time to actually move on from it.  
   97
   I was 20 years old when this happened. I was with a group of friends in the bar last December 2016. What happened was there was a confrontation involving one of my friends and a stranger from another group. Probably because of alcohol things heated up so we rushed to our friend in order to help. However, the other group had just too many people and they really wanted to fight. Because almost every time we are there they would really want to fight with us. My body felt cold because it was the first time and it was really serious. And I think this stands out the most because it was the first time and I never saw myself getting involved in. These made me a more cautious person and helped me to stay away from this kind of group.  
   98
   I was 15 years old, my father was not around because of work so it was just me, my mother and two siblings. At first, my mother didn¡¯t want to evacuate because she was concerned about our house and things.  However, when the typhoon is at its peak we decided to go, at that time my mother was almost hit by flying debris, it was very traumatic. 
   99
   I am 19 years old. A whole day external event for our organization and I was the head responsible for everything. January 26, 2019, in school. Me, my orgmates (members of the same group/club) and 200 plus students from around Tacloban and 301 coaches. I was thinking if it was possible for the event to become successful. I was feeling very ashamed for every little mistake because I want to be the one supporting. It stands out the most because it happened very recently prior to their study. It says about how my self-esteem is.  For my past, I think I failed all the people who trusted me to have this position before, present- I failed the whole organization, future-I think I¡¯ll become more thorough for organizing everything and making sure everything is set.

   I was 11-12 years old back then when we were under my stepfather¡¯s house. In a month there would be 2 to 3 cases where in my stepfather would beat us. The reason for beating us was because we would come home late from playing with friends. If we exceed the 10 PM curfew then expect to be beaten. I and my brother were the constant victims his beating, sometimes my mother when she would use herself as a shield for us. I was thinking back to then, that when I grow up I would like to separate from that house with my mother, sister, and brother. I just feel so hopeless back then knowing that I couldn¡¯t do anything except to accept the fact that we are afraid of our stepfather. This experience stands out the most because I couldn¡¯t bear to see mother and brother smiling in that house knowing when will be next beating from our stepfather. This experience will always be a reminder that I shouldn¡¯t be like my stepfather. That my future kids will not experience a single beating from me. That the cycle must end with me. 
   101
    I was 16 years old at that time the event happened. It was during I was looking in a broken down supermarket for some food and other supplies. As I was walking around a stranger came in and pointed a knife at me, asking me to hand over what I¡¯ve got.  In relation, I also pulled out my own for self-defense. Fortunately, other people saw and held the other person down. In my mind, it took a long time before the situation was resolved, although it only lasted a few minutes. Since then, I became more alert and less trusting to the people around me. However, I don¡¯t think that event changed me negatively. 
   102
   I was 14 or 15 years old at that time. It was night time when the typhoon struck. I and my family stayed in our house because we thought it would be just like other typhoons that we had in the past. Later on, the wind and the rain got even worse and they are already water inside the house. My father started evacuating our things to a relative¡¯s house and we evacuated also. On our way, there were trees falling and debris going our way. When we got to uncle¡¯s house. We stayed on the room where they store their grains. All of us where there because this main house was also on knee-height water. Inside that storage room, I feel scared that the typhoon will not stop yet and the water will continue rising and reach our room. In that typhoon, our house was destroyed, some parts of the wall and the floor remained, but we still live thereafter. This was my most traumatic experience because I never thought we would experience it because we were expecting that it would be just like any other typhoons that had passed. Through this event, I and my family learned to prepare whenever there are warnings.
   103
   My most traumatic experience was my father¡¯s death because I was only thirteen then and when he started to get sick, I have been living alone because he and my mother were in a far City for his medication. The days since his diagnosis were the saddest in my life because I really couldn¡¯t afford to lose a father. We were very close and after his death, I always feel the emptiness in me, like I would always remember him especially when I¡¯m alone and think what could¡¯ve happened to me and our family if he was still here. Because honestly, things have changed when he left. Ever since I always feel like I¡¯m searching for something or whatever.  
   104
    I think I was nine years old at that time. When we were just kids. Our mother would sometimes make us shower together to save some time in preparing to go to school. One time, one of my brothers and I shower together and my brother started ¡°cleaning¡± me down there. At least that¡¯s what he told me. I didn¡¯t know what was happening then. I noted that it took him a long period of time and it was starting to hurt. When I told him this, he stopped and finish bathing. I did not tell my parents anything because I thought it was nothing. This happened again after a few days and my parents still don¡¯t have a clue about what was happening. Growing up, I did not really think about this particular experience. Neither did I have nightmares about this. I thought that this experience stands out the most because when they asked about the worst event that happened in my life this stood out. I think that this experience caused me to be reserved and shy when dealing with other people. This experience will definitely help me in the future to prevent it from happening it to me again or to someone I know. 
   105
   I was 14 years old and it was during the typhoon. Our house was already partially damaged and a lot of the debris already fell and blocked the main exit. We were seven at that time and we were feeling hopeless. The only shelter we got was our wooden table and with a few more debris, we were almost sure we were going to die. My grandmother was with us and she kept on telling us to go seek help and just leave her there. I was crying and I don¡¯t want her to keep suggesting it. A few more minutes, debris almost hit my father in the head if it weren¡¯t for my cousin's reflexes. I accidentally pushed my father out of our mini shelter that¡¯s why he was almost hit. I felt guilty almost every time I see him. It made me think my carelessness could really be fatal. I felt ashamed. 
   106
    I was 15 years old when Yolanda happened. It was the strongest super typhoon ever experienced. There was raining and strong winds outside that were felt inside the house. The walls were shaking despite it being made of cement. Flood/water entered the house and consistently increase in level. I believe it was the next level or near my height already. Branches were falling, roots of other neighbor¡¯s house were detached and their house even collapsed. I even saw a ¡°swirling¡± of the water outside our house. Things were messy inside and outside. We were all wet because our roof was starting to detach as well and water was pouring. It was so cold. This happened last November 8, 2013, and we were just staying at home. My family was my companion and when we were joined by our neighbors because the house got destroyed and it was already dangerous for them to stay there. I was just wondering as to why it was happening and what would happen to us and everyone else afterward. I was thinking of our relatives and my classmates as to how they were doing. I was not panicking but I was worried. I was praying and just listened to what my father would ask me to. I was worried because of the water that was not stopping from rising, but thanks to God a wall in our compound collapsed and so the water spread. It stood out because it was the worst calamity I have ever experienced. I believe that this experience plays a lesson. It was a lesson that we should not have been complacent in the past, it makes us stronger right now, and in the future, we are aware of what to do already. 
   107
    I think I was 10 years old at the time. I was on my way home from school riding a multi-cab. A man beside me, his hand slowly inched towards my breasts. I have very hazy memories about the experience and don¡¯t like thinking about it. I remember feeling so confused and not really knowing or realizing what was happening to me. I know that at the time, I didn¡¯t really understand the notion of sexual harassment but also felt that what was being done to me was wrong. This experience bothers me the most because, at that time, I felt so powerless. Now, I can think of a multitude of ways I could¡¯ve prevented to experience, but at that time, I didn¡¯t do anything. I didn¡¯t know if I was too young or dumb. I believe this experience has caused me to distrust men in general. For the longest time, I was very uncomfortable around men older than I am. The notion of anyone experiencing any form of sexual harassment evokes strong feelings from me and generally makes me feel very uncomfortable. 
   108
   I was 16 years old with the typhoon happened. There were these strong winds and rains that wiped out the roof of our house, broke our windows and eventually our gate. It was the morning of November 8th, 2014. I was with my family back in my hometown during the typhoon. I remember thinking about praying for the typhoon to stop. All of us were shivering and scared as we stayed in a room.  I choose this experience because not only that, it injured so much stress and pain on me, It also scared my family as well. My mother developed this anxiety whenever it rains and is still experiencing the anxiety up until now. I can say that this experience proved that, somehow, despite my introvertedness and weakness, I can be brave and strong. This experience inspired me to deal with my problems as I am constantly reminded that I have done and experienced worse situations, and will definitely survive whatever the present or future holds. 
   109
    This is really not my story to tell but this shared experience by my close friend has really disturbed me ever since because unlike other things that happened to me or my relatives and friends these traumatic experiences were caused or inflicted to her by the people around her. She told me it began when she was still in his grade 6 until now she¡¯s already in fourth-year college. It was not just some passengers that sexually assaulted her one time it was her uncle who did it. And she told me that big a victim of this is very difficult when someone is sexually assaulting you, you can¡¯t really make a move to defend yourself will just arrive at your house and cry yourself to sleep every time. This made me alert when I am on public transport. It would also make me look back and examine who¡¯s beside me. It affected me really much that I too lost trust in people around me.

   I was 15 years old when I experienced Typhoon Yolanda. We were in the evacuation center with other people during landfall. I was so afraid with the typhoon landed. I was crying the whole time, praying that it would stop soon. For me, this is the most Traumatic experience, my family was in danger. My father got lost the whole time Yolanda landed. We were in panic at that time.
   111
   I was 18. I was repeatedly failing my math class in school. I felt shame and fear. It gave me trauma and a constant reminder that I am a failure.  
   112
   I was 15 years old with typhoon Haiyan struck Ormoc City. I was with my family at my grandpa¡¯s house except for my father who stayed in our house the guard it. I felt scared and at that same time sad for that reason that I thought we will not survive that incident. My sadness just came from the fact that father was not with us. 
   113
    I was 10 years old back then. It was raining hard and I am about to cross the highway because it was lunchtime. Suddenly a lady was hit by a bus because she was not able to see it coming. I was actually shocked to witness an actual accident in front of me. Maybe the reason why I can¡¯t forget that one because that was unexpected and it was my first time to witness such. 
   114
    I was about 14 or 15 years old at that time when something unexpected happened in my life. We were having a class at that time at a seven-floor building. Our teachers were busy talking in front of the class when we heard noises like a spring that is being stretched and then we felt the vibration of swaying building. We were shocked and didn¡¯t know what to do at that time that even our teacher could not utter any more words. We were praying it would finally stop. Some were already crying saying that we could die at any moment. I was totally scared thinking that I would die in an earthquake. There were aftershocks that happened that we were instructed to settle out temporarily outside the building. I would say that this experience stands out the most because it was by far the very first experience of a six-point something magnitude earthquake. 
   115
   I was 18 years old.  I was already super bent on going to a boarding house under the pretense that the dorm will not be open to continuing students the next year. One day I received a message saying that I was accepted to stay at the dorm one year more. There, the conflict arose regarding whether I would continue with the dorm life or have a change of pace with living in a boarding house. The peculiar thing about that whole reaction was that I never really knew why I cried, it just sort of came about from all the surrounding confusion. I can¡¯t stop thinking about it really, whether my decision was rational and why I reacted that way. 
   116
   The year was 2015. I just graduated from high school and was enjoying my four-month break before entering the University of the Philippines. One day in July, we suddenly got the news that my stepfather was involved in an accident. Now thinking about it was really traumatic. Other people died in that accident and somehow they were trying to blame my stepfather. He was just a driver of the truck, he did not have any idea that there was something wrong beforehand with the truck. Well, the good thing was the owner of the truck which was the company where my stepfather work shouldered all expenses including the other victims. Everyone in the family was restless including me. Someone might threaten our lives, nobody was at ease. Because my mother was always the one who had to take care of him, she had always to be alert and stressed about everything. Little did we know she was pregnant, and by the next few days she had a miscarriage. The worst thing was the next day was the upcoming freshman orientation at the University. I did not have any other choice but to attend orientation all by myself. It was my first time traveling alone. I did not have a good time during those days because my mind was just everywhere. Even during those times I sometimes have this thought that maybe I should not have entered the University and sometimes even blame myself. Maybe this was one of the reasons why I find myself quite anxious often. But I have learned how to control these negative feelings. I¡¯m quite good at concealing my feelings though. Because during those times I was trying out to have a breakdown, everyone was also depressed. Someone must at least become strong and maintain a straight face.  
   117
   I was only 14 years old when that traumatic event happened to me. During the devastation of the super typhoon Yolanda, my family and I were at the rooftop waiting for the typhoon. I thought that I was going to die that day. But what scares me the most was to see my loved ones moving towards death. I honestly have no idea how that traumatic incident affects who or what I am now. Maybe the way I respond to things or subconsciously affected because of that incident. 
   118
   I was six years old back then when after a long walk from school at eating my lunch at home, I together with my little sister tried to open a bottle thinking that the liquid inside was water. Because I was the stronger one, I was able to open the tightly capped bottle after my little sister tried and failed. So, after having drunk about 3/4 of the liquid it was only then that our parents saw me drinking kerosene. After that, breathing has been very difficult for me as my parents panic. Then after a minute or more, I think I fainted. Even at my age back then, I was really conscious that I might actually die at that time. I think that the experience had really struck me the most because of that incident that I develop this kind of attitude that I would double check things up. 
   119
   Nearly 13 or 14 years old we were on our way to my mother¡¯s hometown when it happened. The truck was driving too fast when we were near one bridge and it suddenly turns to our driveway area. It was around 2011 with my parents I was really nervous and I even thought that I was about to die. Personally, it motivated me to learn how to drive a car so that I could take note and learn how to do it right and literally boost the other drivers to drive safely and follow road rules so that everyone is safe. 
   120
    I was 21 years old. I came home late from school. Since I still need to travel for an hour to get home, I probably arrived around 8 PM. I arrived at the same time my father did. Then, I heard him screaming my name and my mother¡¯s name. I saw him resuscitated my mother. I called for an ambulance thinking everything will be fine. I partly blamed myself for coming home late and for not calling and checking on my mother. Later I blamed my father for not checking up on her. This experience stood out the most because my mother was involved and everything was so sudden. I was not expecting it. I have been away from home for one year and a half and I missed my mother. Yet, after being home for only nine months she died¡¦suddenly. I don¡¯t even know why.
   121
   I was 18 years old at that time it was the time when I started having constant anxiety attacks that made me difficult to concentrate and think effectively. It happened to me right after when I started running for student council of UP Tacloban. At first, I really doubted myself if I can really handle it but my family and friends wholeheartedly supported me.  However, even though I know my capacities as a person, it was really hard for me to handle it due to the fact that my academics was a big hindrance. Also, it was the time when my mother was diagnosed with cancer. It made it difficult to think and focus on things. There were multiple times that I wanted I want to cry alone and give up everything. I consider this as one of the most traumatic yet memorable since it made me realize the strength encourage that I have. 
   122
    I was maybe 16 or 17 years old back then when it happened. It was during a trip to Manila with my mother. It happened during the night and there were no lights except for the headlights of the van. I was asleep when one of the drivers was seated next to me, I was disturbed by the hot feeling traveling up and down and squeezing my hips, that¡¯s when I knew it was the hand of the driver. That time I was terrified and try to wake up my mother and the other passenger¡¯s right in front of me. When the hand moved inside my shirt and started to make its way into my chest. I screamed at the man and woke up everybody. I can¡¯t forget that night, I can¡¯t forget how that man denied everything. I can¡¯t forget how the other passengers turn a blind eye. Since then, it became hard for me to travel, and to mingle with other males even with my relatives. I have a certain a distrust to every driver I see most of all I can¡¯t sleep at night. This experience surely did put a toll and trick barrier to protect myself from every man I met. It happened years ago, and I don¡¯t think I can forget it for the next year to come. 
   123
     I was 15 years old when Yolanda struck Tacloban. We were staying at the XYZ hotel at that time. By 6 AM we went down to have breakfast while eating and waiting for other food to arrive, water slowly seeped into the hotel. The management staff decided to lead us and evacuate to the second floor. Since the elevator was not functioning, I had to drag or Carry my grandmother on the wheelchair up the stairs. I was started to drag the wheelchair up, the glass window broke and water came flooding in. With much adrenaline, it helped me carry the wheelchair up to the stairs quickly. At that moment, I felt a rush to make sure we became safe. This stand out the most as the situation on hand has my life and my grandmother¡¯s life. I might accidentally let go of the wheelchair which could have killed my grandmother. The experience highlights how I value the life of my family.  
   124
   I was 19 years old. As the leader of the organization and the head of the event. I was expected to make certain important decisions. But prior to my being put in that position, I was already a very anxious person and I ever had anxiety attacks when I was younger. I see myself with not enough confidence for everything. I became conscious of what the older members would react. I started to fear people. I avoided them on purpose. I became unsure of everything that I was doing. I reached the point where I cried every night for three weeks. Others who did not see me often would comment that I got thinner, and I always thought it was because of the stress. Now, that was over, I was able to assess how it affected me. How I wasn¡¯t myself when that was happening. I see that situation as a result also of how I am unable to communicate my thoughts well and for not being firm with my decisions. I¡¯ve always had this problem of not being able to verbally speak what I think. Thus, I think that situation was the most awful that have felt about myself. 
   125
   I was 14 years old. Can¡¯t recall the exact date but around 4 to 5 weeks, my cousin who was able to salvage his car got hold of gas sufficient for us to go around the province and check on the relatives and friends. I was with both my parents and the above-mentioned cousin was the one driving. More than the anxiety of not knowing how people we know we¡¯re doing, finding out within a span of a day just how many of them died made severe anxiety seem much preferable over dealing with multiple losses in such a short period of time. This experience is my absolute worst because it felt like I was never prepared for it and that I love was not given enough time to process one death before confirming another. Since then, the death of people that I know seems to have an amplified effect on me to the point that I¡¯d break down and cry even if the person who died was not really that close to me. 
   126
   When our house got involved in the fire accident, almost all of my family members died including me. I was almost 2 years old when it happened. I couldn¡¯t exactly remember what happened because I was still young. However, I kept dreaming about fire and burning ever since then. Our house is located in Palo, Leyte and our neighbor started a fire (accidentally). Their whole family was burned to death including a baby. I could not remember how I felt back then, but because I kept on dreaming about the tragedy and my siblings kept on talking to me about it, it remains in me, and maybe even through with me. The experience stands out because it now becomes a lesson learned, and this experience made me more careful about things. 
   127
   I was about 14 years old when Yolanda struck the City of Tacloban. It was two days before my 15th birthday. We thought it was just a typical typhoon just like any other typhoons. But the typhoon left around 6,000 to 8,000 victims dead. I thought everything is going to be normal again after two days. I was sad and devastated at the same time knowing a lot of my fellow Taclobanons (used to refer to the people of Tacloban) are dead. Having a hard time looking for food and water. I was lucky and blessed that I was still alive after the devastation of the super typhoon. I consider this life I have now as my second chance at a good one. 
   128
    I was 10 years old when I witnessed on television an execution of an abducted person. I feel like it was also done to me but at the same time, I¡¯m also aware that it isn¡¯t. I feel that this experience stands out the most because it affected my everyday life and my ways of dealing with situations or things. 
   129
   When I was five years old, l my older cousin rape me. I only realize that now that I am an adult. It happened at the house of my grandma because he asked me to play ¡°Balay-Balay¡± (playhouse). I will be the mother and he will be the father that moment, I thought that nothing was wrong not until today. At some point, I feel scared when I am around with the boys¡¯ maybe that was the influenced of my past. 
   130
   My most traumatic experience was when my sister almost got raped and my father accidentally cut off his thumb. I was 15 years old when my sister was almost got raped. As soon as I saw my sister full of blood in her head, I burst into tears. For months, I felt scared of going home late at night. Another experience that bothered me was when my father accidentally cut off his thumb which happened last year 2018. I felt sad because of that although these experiences happened to my family I don¡¯t think it really affected me in the long run. I felt sad for months after the incident but I learned to get over it and learn from that experience.

   I was 18 years old when my brother died from dengue and encephalitis. It was sudden because the doctor said he was getting better and we¡¯re hoping that he would get discharged from the hospital. My mother and I were involved and it was very hard for us because we already lost my father when I was two years old. I felt sadness anger and guilt at that time. I look for people to blame and even blame myself. In contrast to how I felt before it happened. I stay positive and avoid the possibility of losing my brother. This experience stands out the most because it happened to one of the people closest to me and it changed my outlook in life. 
   132
   I was 17 years old at that time when super typhoon Yolanda struck our place. I was living at fisherman¡®s Village San Jose that is why the effect of the typhoon in our family is just that big. My siblings and I evacuated to my aunt¡¯s house which is still in the San Jose area. My parents decided to stay at home at that time period. That morning of November 8, 2013, was the most terrifying moment of my life. We were stuck at the roof for almost 2 hours without food or anything at all. When the typhoon ended we thought that our parents were already dead because gossips are everywhere, that all the people from fisherman¡®s Village perished. It was only after three days when we saw her parent alive. We hugged each other in the middle of the road. The experience made me realize how I should value the existence of my family for we don¡¯t know how long they will live in this world. 
   133
   I was 14 years old when the typhoon Yolanda had its first landfall in our town, Guiuan. It was almost 4 AM and the wind blew so strong that our roof started getting blown off from the ceiling. The whole family hid inside the comfort room for almost until 10 AM. And during that time we could hear the whistling sound made by the strong wind. And there were glasses that were stored above the bathroom¡¯s ceiling and the only thing that kept was those glasses from falling onto us was thin plywood that my father and older brother tried to support the entire time we were in there. The water began to rise about up to my knees but eventually settled down it was scary especially when we were hearing loud thuds and noises probably caused by the big tree falling down by mother was crying and so my little brother. The only thing that was keeping me calm that time was my little sister sleeping the entire time. It was really cold at that time and it was very dark. After we finally got out of the bathroom, when my parents thought it was safe, I believe it had something to do with climate change that¡¯s why I am now more aware of its causes and why it happened. It made me more conscious about how I treat the environment. 
   134
   When the event happened I was 10 years old. He did Level things to me but I never told anyone about it, because it¡¯s embarrassing. I wasn¡¯t really thinking that it was bad at first, but I¡¯ve never felt so vulnerable and weak. The whole time I was just thinking to suck it up so it could end already. This event stands out the most because it made me who I am today. It made me fearsome of people who are not close to me. 
   135
   I was about 15 years old with typhoon Yolanda hit the country. I was at home with my mom and siblings when it happened. When the water started to rise and part of our roof was blown away by the strong winds. I was afraid. I lost some of my relatives and friends to the typhoon. What made the experience was the fact that my dad wasn¡¯t with us and it was very difficult to contact him. Being the eldest, I had to be strong for both my mom and brothers. His experience helped me become a strong-willed woman who is ready to face any challenges that life has to offer. 
   136
   I can¡¯t remember exactly when it happened. All I know that it was evening. My family and I were inside her house. I experienced a handful of earthquakes already. Most of them were short and not strong. But that night, it was a strong earthquake. Our things were violently shaking. I was waiting for it to stop, but it didn¡¯t. Everyone started to scream and get out of the house. So we went out with our heads ducked. Just a short while, it stopped. I saw my neighbors on the street also. Then my parents decided to go to a higher place in case there will be a tsunami. All I know is that I just grabbed a few clothes.I think my mother, brought some important documents. It was a 5 to 10 minutes travel. There were a lot of people on the road, maybe to evacuate also. I remember worrying about all my friends and of course my close family members. We stayed at the house where we evacuated for one night only. 
   137
   I think I was around 11 years old with this traumatic event occurred. It was a sunny day perhaps it was a weekend around Sunday. I was in my parent¡¯s room when I suddenly heard cries in the dispute going on. These people who are involved were our neighbors the father, daughter and a son. So they were three in total but I am not sure if the wife was there. I felt worried and not entirely scared but afraid because of the shots being fired. This experience stood out because it was a life-and-death experience, perhaps brutal and unexpected. This experience taught me to be really careful. This experience tells me that I am someone who is careful and someone who dislike violence. This experience shows as a lesson for me to be objective and to not let my emotions take the best of me. 
   138
   The night before the event, I fixed up our things to get ready to move out to a safer location where we stayed for around a week or two. The typhoon was already felt due to continuous and heavy rains. I was more worried for my grandmother who was nearly 80 years old at that time. I was around 16 years old and my mother at around 42 years old. The reasons we moved is because our home is located near a mountain and our location is a bit known for heavy flooding. On the day of the event the raging typhoon was deafening and the rains were kind up blocking our vision thankfully, we were not that affected on the majority of those in Tacloban and other places. One thing that frightened me as well when another family went in for shelter (we stayed at Leyte National High School TLE Guestroom) and heard their story that their house was washed out by the flood. It was horrifying at that moment and at the same time saddened. But I was very thankful that we were safe, especially to my grandmother and mother.  
   139
   I was 15 years old when the traumatic event happened to me. The typhoon Yolanda hit our town back in 2013. My family and I had to move from our house to our van while the storm is still ongoing. Because the store had already ripped off the ceiling of the house at that time, I was just thinking that no matter what I have to get out alive and survived the storm, but as soon as the eye and the winds get stronger I lost all hope to live. I was even ready to die. I think this experience stands out the most because it brought countless changes to my life. 
   140
   I was 15 years old during Yolanda. We were just in our house at San Jose when it made its landfall. My whole family was with me the whole time. My mother gets scared easily so growing up, I had learned how to behave in such manner that wouldn¡¯t affect my mom. Besides that, during the catastrophe, I had nothing else in mind but the survival of the family and what to do next. All I had in mind was I had to be strong, dad and I will be able to get through it. It stands out because it was sudden and somewhat preventable.  The experience gave me perspective on life that would play a role since then, throughout my life.
   141
   I was 14 years old by then, it was very surprising that there was a big typhoon coming even if the weather was perfectly fine that is why my family did not feel the rush to prepare for the typhoon. I was in Eastern Samar at the time being. When it reached nightfall, suddenly the power went off. I immediately worried about my aunt, uncle, and cousins since they were living at V&G subdivision and it is known to be prone to floods. After a week, the signal was still limited but we were able to make calls, we were so worried about them since, we were not able to contact them. We did not know if they were still alive. My mother also, who is an OFW, immediately came home from hearing the news that Tacloban was purely wiped out. She came home because she cannot contact us also. She also thought that we were dead. I was feeling worried, I did not know what to do. I was occupied by the thoughts that many people were dead. That experience made me and my family strong that is why our experience with Yolanda stands out the most.
   142
   I was 14 years old, we were at the house with my family. We didn't prepare anything because we underestimate the said typhoon. It was morning the typhoon Yolanda started destroying our windows and everything. We are really afraid because the water is rising our whole first floor. We were thinking of how we will survive in this kind of situation. This experience stands out the most because of the fear that we feel. It is a lesson that we must prepare, we must not underestimate the typhoon. 
   143
   I was 13 back then when that traumatic event happened. I was brought to the hospital because of having or experiencing kidney failure. I was thinking of giving up and I felt sad for myself. I also felt pity for my parents since they have sacrificed a lot. This particular experience stands out the most because my whole family was involved even if I was the only one who was suffering. This experience also taught us how to be strong and having faith in God. 
   144
   I was 14 years old at that time during Yolanda. We were fine during and after the typhoon but 8 of my family members from Samar died because of it. They were not found until then. I was so sad that time because they were the people whom I grew up with and they are so close to my heart. It made me realize one thing, life is too short, that we will never know when our life ends will.
   145
   I was only 14 years old when I experienced suffering from Yolanda. It caught us off guard because we thought that it just like the other natural disaster, it won¡¯t be that strong. We suffered from having no electricity, no water consumption and not enough food supply. Plus, everyone believed the rumors that NPA¡¯s and Mangyans are planning to attack our place. The storm happened on November 8, 2018, but the fear lasted for more than a week after the incident. Everyone in my hometown is involved for sure. I was praying that it will soon end and I was still feeling hopeful because my family and friends are there for me but I somehow survived because it affected my studies so much. I learned so much through this event, I learned to remain brave, strong, and hopeful. I also learned to appreciate what is still there because it may be gone in one blink. I learned to value my family and friends more. 
   146
   When super typhoon Yolanda happened, I was probably 14/15 years old. We were at our home on November 8, 2013. While the sound of the strong wind and air was bothering us, we were hiding in our parent¡¯s room. While my brother was with my grandmother and aunt in a spare room. My brother soon noticed that the water was getting into our house, and when we checked outside, the only thing preventing the ¡°storm surge¡± to get into our house was our front door. So we rushed upstairs as fast as we could, and not even 20 seconds goes by, our front door wreck in half and water starts flowing in. within minutes, our whole 1st floor was filled by water that was likely 10-12 feet and we were lucky we survived. At that time I wasn¡¯t thinking that we were going to make it. Of course, I felt scared, but as long as my family okay then I will be at ease too. This event will forever be a huge part of our lives, because it changed a lot of things, just like that. 
   147
   I am 19 years old now. We were trucked by the super typhoon Yolanda. It happened during 2013 November 8. Many people were involved including my family. I am afraid that time, I thought we can¡¯t survive. This particular experience stands out the most because my life was at risk and it causes me so much fear during that time. That experience made me realize to call for God every time not only during happy times but also during difficulties. It taught me to be stronger and be independent at all times. 
   148
   The most traumatic happened to me is the time typhoon Yolanda struck Region 8. I was 13 years old at that time. During that time I and my whole family stayed indoors waiting for the typhoon to pass. During that time I feel really scared. I had the feeling of anxiety and fear with the thought of ¡°there is no way out.¡± After the typhoon, our house was 90% damage. But it was not the problem. I witnessed the other people walking without direction in finding ways to survive. While on the other hand here I am thinking when will our supply will last. 
   149
   I was 14 years old when typhoon Haiyan brought disaster in the City I live. It was approximately 3 in the morning when the strong winds started. There was already an electric power shortage. My father went to the 2nd floor to check if there were some windows broken since the wind was already blowing. But not only glasses from the windows were broken but also the roof was trying to be blown by the wind. It was traumatic seeing our home being ruined while we were inside. 
   150
   It happened to me when I was 8 years old. It was September 2008 when my aunt told us about the death of my father, which occurred on August 20, 2008. That moment the beans were spilled. I was at a state of shock and deep sorrow, despite the years passed, this wound won¡¯t seem to heal. The troubled memories of the past would sometimes haunt me with flashbacks, accompanied by emotions. This particular event for me stood out, by the mere fact. It redefined my life as a human being. Though it had occurred a decade ago, it continues to haunt my present, and will probably persist in the future.
   151
   I was still 13 years old back then. It was really an unforgettable memory. The fear, the traumatic event and everything, the mixed emotions that you couldn¡¯t understand. I am with my family it happened last November 8, 2013, at V and G Tacloban. I thought of something like ¡°is this the end of my life?¡± This was the particular experience that stands out the most because the state of feeling that you cannot describe exactly of what it is and I can say that I¡¯m brave enough because I can handle my emotions so far. These particular event has been my source of bravery in no matter what circumstances I¡¯ve faced nowadays.
   152
   When I was 6 years old, physically abused and witnessed some rude things. When we ¡¯re on a vacation with ate Lina and my Kuya¡¯s (relatives). Thinking about it I feel frustrated at the same time. I want it to be erased in my memories. Maybe because up until now I can¡¯t trust anyone that is why I kept it in myself and remain it as a secret. 
   153
   I always remember this incident. Everything I heard from other people similar to this scenario. I have this strong negative feeling.  
   154
   I was 13 years old at that time, I never had the clue of what would really happen to us because it was our first time to have that kind of situation. Yes, we were able to experience typhoon but this one was so strong compared to what happened years before. It occurred last Nov. 8, 2013, I was with my family and we were just at home. In the midst of the typhoon, I was just thinking of what would happen to us in the next hours, since our house was already damaged and the water insider is already on our knees. We just prayed and offer ever everything to God, we forced ourselves to calm and think positively. We tried not to be negative in thinking about things so that we can manage the situation. We just waited for the typhoon to calm down and after it, we help hand in hand to raise ourselves from this traumatic calamity.
   155
   I was 19 years old when I was walking alone in the street almost 11 pm coming from Tacloban and then I¡¯m waiting for a tricycle. Then someone came to me and he is totally a stranger. He wants me to come with him. It was at the highway I came home from Tacloban after our training in ROTC. I ran immediately away from him and I realized I was at the burger junction which was a relief for me because there are a lot of people there. That was one of the worse experience I ever had and a lesson learned from me. 
   156
   I was about 13 years old since the traumatic experience happened. I never thought that it would be a terrible situation experiencing the wrath of the typhoon Yolanda. I was at my aunt¡¯s house, we evacuated there together with my siblings. As far as I knew, the house is located nearby the sea but it¡¯s not obvious in Tanauan, Leyte. That time, it was almost close to death because during the strong winds that Yolanda brought, huge water came into our house damaging our properties. Things floated everywhere almost reaching the ceiling of the house. Luckily we didn¡¯t drown. 
   157
   I was 13 years old when I experienced the super typhoon Yolanda in our house at Tacloban City. I and my were family stuck up on the second floor of our house due to the storm surge, we were all crying and praying. This experience stands out the most because I thought we couldn¡¯t survive. This experience really affected my personality. 
   158
   I am 19 years old. The event was the worst natural disaster that ever hit in our place. I witnessed how people lost their homes, how it caused trauma, but whatever happened, we continued praying for our safety. All people were involved but the casualties were worst (most number) in Leyte. This happened on November 8, 2013. At that moment, my mind was blank, the feeling was complicated, all I can remember was that I was crying the whole time. As I observed our home being ruined. But, the worst part was that my father found my grandfather lying on the side street of Sagkahan, his skin was bublling, and was dead. It was so sudden!
   159
   At the age of 13, when typhoon Yolanda hit in town it was a very traumatic experience, mostly in Eastern Visayas. I and my family were strongly involved. I thought that it was our end and that death could possibly meet us, everything is still vivid. Experiencing the greatest typhoon in the world is never easy that¡¯s why it stands out the most, our life was in great danger. I was able to be strong enough after I¡¯ve experienced the typhoon and I could bring this strong wind not only to this present but as well as my future time. My past experience made me a strong person and even now I¡¯m much stronger to overcome such situation. 
   160
   I was about 10 years old at that time when this typhoon came and devastated our place. It happened on the month of November 8, 2018, at Abuyog, Leyte. I was with my family in our little old house with no idea this would be catastrophic. I trembled in fear in the corner of our house hoping the surges of waves being heard and the sifting of winds in our house shaking it up like a strong earthquake. This experience will always echo in my heart and my mind because I always dream of it every night. How I witness such deadly typhoon at my age with soft and worriless heart. It made me less ignorant, strong hearted and made me more alert and vigilant to safeguard my life, my family and other people.
   161
   It happened when I was in the 3rd grade. I had seatmate who at that time was way older than me, like not the normal age for a third grader. He sexually assaulted me and I had no idea to react. It happened during class. Not only that, back then my cousin got me into an unwanted sexual experience when he touched my private part. It was really traumatizing. There are times when I couldn¡¯t handle my emotions when I tend to think or remember it. I involuntary shout and scratch my arm.
   162
   I was 13 years old. It was December 8, 2012, in Basey, Samar. I  and my family were affected. That time I felt nervous, sad when many people were suddenly caught in the middle of that  natural calamity like for example, other people died because of landslide and other unusual calamities.This experience even it was not good but I think it was helpful because it gave me a strength to have a strong faith to God and to believe to my compassion. And friend and especially to my family. This play in my past being polite to others.  At present, I still have strong faith in God and believe in my family and myself. It helps me to be an independent person. I have the courage to surpass those struggle that I face.
        163
   I was 16 years old when my mom burnt half of her body because of the oven.  It was dawn when it happened and my father was not there, just my siblings and a helper in our house who also sustained burns.  It was a loud bang that woke me and the voice of our helper seeking for help to take away the pain and I was inside the bakery and I see my mother suffering also and I don¡¯t know how could I help her. It was really a traumatic event for me because at that time a lot of events happened. My grandmother was in a coma and my father was not there. I needed to step up from my young age and it was hard coping up.
       164 (NONE)
       165
   During the tragic event like the Yolanda typhoon. I was 13 years old at that time. It was too hard for us at that time because of the disaster. There was a lack of resources at that time and the feeling was hard and very painful, the feeling of being hopeless and being afraid of what will happen in the next few days.
   166
   I was13 years old. We were at our house. Our neighbor went to our house because their house was destroyed. It was in November 2013. My whole family was involved. During that time, I couldn¡¯t think properly of what I should do because my heart was pounding so hard every time the winds blew hard. My only plan was to hold the strongest foundation of the house. This stands out the most because it was my first time to walk being injured in a flooded place.
   167
   I think it was just last year. I made a mistake so I will not make it very detailed. I don¡¯t know maybe I¡¯ll just keep it for myself for the meantime.
   168
   I was 14 years old back then when typhoon Yolanda devastated our place. The wind and the rain were so strong that you could almost hear what it sounds like and it can almost throw you away even if you were inside the house. It also almost destroyed our house. My family and I even had to stay in a convent in our place which was safer than our house. What I was thinking was tomorrow, what will happen or will we still be able to survive. This event stands out the most because it was the strongest typhoon I¡¯ve encountered in my whole life and it showed me how I should value every second with my family.
   169
   I was 14 years old at that time. It happened 5 years ago when typhoon Yolanda hits the same part in the Visayas very hard and it caused lots of people to die. I don¡¯t know what to do at that time. But because my family was there for us. I think that time that I can manage or we can manage to stand up despite what happened.
   170
   I was 19 years old. Typhoon Yolanda was the most traumatic event for me back in 2013. My family and my relatives, sad to say one of my relatives passed away due to severe bleeding during the storm surge that hit their barangay. I was hopeless and sad because of what happened. This is the first time I encountered such typhoon in my entire life. This experience taught me to become strong and not letting my dreams get affected.
   171
   I was 12 years old when Yolanda happened. We witnessed a strong typhoon in our place. We evacuated to our aunt¡¯s house. My family were there. We were very worried if we could still survive. Worrying about what will happen to our future because of what happened because almost all of our properties vanished. But after this, it helped me figure out to become strong even though there are lots of problems and always have faith in God.
   172
   I was 13 years old when it happened. The super Typhoon Yolanda. Our house back then was near the sea so we evacuated to the house of my aunt. It was a concrete house. Then by 4 in the morning, we were sleeping when we suddenly felt that the floor was wet and it was the water. We panicked to the point that we didn¡¯t know what to do because the water was getting higher. All of my family were involved. I thought that we were going to die and I was afraid.
   173
   Other than the car accident I was traumatized about what happened to me last 2017. I was 18 and I all alone in my apartment. Then a stranger went into me. I was sleeping at that time and I have no clue what¡¯s going on until I heard a voice, I thought there was only one but when I knew someone was there, I wake up and saw 2 men opening the drawer, cabinets and my other bag. I was so scared they might hurt me so I stayed quiet. Luckily, they did not care about me and just left the apartment after they took some things. After that incident I had trouble sleeping I can¡¯t sleep at night thinking that someone might rob me again. I¡¯ve been so anxious that I have to change my sleeping position, like sleeping next to the door so that I will know whether someone is coming or not. Until today, I¡¯m still thinking about it. But aside from this event, I was also traumatized when my 2 siblings were trapped here in Tacloban during the typhoon. There was no communication and we thought they were dead we thought they were dead because according to people there are thousands of people that died during the typhoon. We tried to rescue them and look from them in those difficult times, until we met friends of my siblings and told us they are safe and sound.
   174
   I was13 years old when I experienced the devastation of typhoon Yolanda. We just stayed in our house while the typhoon was happening. The wind was too strong and our door facing to the front of our house has been destroyed. There are lots of roofs from our neighbors coming in and it was scary. My Typhoon Yolanda experience made me strong and resilient that will surely help me overcome whatever challenges I would encounter in the future.
   175
   When my grandfather died last November 2 am 18 years old. It was already expected to happen but it still hurts to see and experience it yourself. He has lung cancer most probably 3 years ago and the doctor said he has only 2 years to live. He died in his own house with my mother and aunt on his side. I¡¯m hurt because I treasure him for my whole life but it is a natural occurrence for a human to die when they are old already. This event in my life is the worst of my experience because in the typhoon Yolanda I only experience some things that can be replaced but when my grandfather died it¡¯s not something that can be replaced.  This experience made me realize that I am strong enough to face my emotions and go on with my life. This experience helped me to be motivated to do my best in all things.
   176
   I was 23 years old when that Yolanda happened. We were left in the office and told to watch the place. Around 5 am we could really feel that the typhoon was hitting our place. First, we look for a place to hide, under the sink because the roof was already uprooted and the debris were falling, we noticed that the water was fast arising and that¡¯s why we decided to climb up above the open roof. We saw that we were surrounded by waters, strong winds blow that can even blow us away. We also witnessed the one house beside the office was carried by waters. By then I have thought that it was the end of my life. I was crying while holding on to the trees above and praying that Jesus would spare my family from what I was experiencing at that very moment. I was terrified, I was already thinking about how my family would find me. Luckily the storm started to slow down and we were saved by the rescuers after.
   177
   I was 14 years old back then when the most traumatizing, unforgettable  and cast down natural disaster had happened in my whole life. We were told to vacate our place because the disaster might take our lives but others won¡¯t believe and just continued to live in that dangerous place of them. We were on our way to our grandma¡¯s house when my cousin called me if we were going to move out of our place and told her yes and little did I know that her mother was still busy doing office works and disregarded the news of the super typhoon so I told her that its ok maybe she will find a place for them to live for a while. So our lives went on. But after 2 hours of the typhoon, I had this bad feeling that there something is wrong. My father went to pay a visit to my aunt bringing a bag full of food but when my father came back I noticed that his bag was still full and that instant, I knew that my aunt and cousin had to leave for the rest of their lives. For the past 4 years, after Yolanda, I always asked for forgiveness for not asking them to come join us as we moved from our place. They will always remain in my heart and that is for sure. I still remember when my cousin always told me to study hard and make my parents proud. If there are stairs towards heaven I would always go to pay them a visit because our life isn¡¯t complete without them. I lost my cousin and auntie without telling them how happy and thankful I am because of them. This typhoon is the worst experience I ever felt. Traumatizing, unforgettable and downcast experience in my whole life I will never forget.
   178
   I was 13 years old at that time when Yolanda hits our province. It was just a fine day of the 7th of November but when dawn comes a heavy rainfall and very strong wind occur that every house, big trees destructed. I was at Ormoc, we had a traumatic experience together with my family at that time. I was very afraid that I want to cry out loud. At that time, I had no idea what the result after this will be. How we will be able to rise up knowing that we lost our house and our relatives were very far away from us. No signal, no food and no means of transportation. But as year pass by we will able to make it. We slowly rise up from falling because of the help of the donations and relief goods. I can say that there is still hope after all the phenomena that happened. We are still blessed that we survived even though there is family member who died it really hurt the pain and memory still haunts me until now we will continue to pray for them and also being positive and being aware on what is happening around us always listening to news and be prepared as always especially trust the Almighty and pray always because nothing is impossible with him .
   180
   I was 19 years old when typhoon Yolanda came and we were in Manila and my uncle and the rest of his family were left in Tacloban. We were so worried and praying that they are alive. I was thinking for the worst, like what if they died, where we are going to start locating them since Taliban City is a very big Area. Because our family is bonded together by the traumatic event of losing my uncle. We were praying and hoping we and his family would live. This made us strong altogether. And I guess I will be able to handle same problem or matter I will be able to handle a difficult situation in the future.                                                                                                 
   181    
    I was 14 years old. I have experienced the most traumatic event when the typhoon Yolanda hit our city. November 8, 2013 is the worst or unforgettable moment with my family and relatives. I felt anxious and sad because it was really unexpected. Experiencing this kind of event made me realize that life is short. It really shows your weakness in life. The best way to overcome is we should help one another and save our mother earth so that we cannot experience this kind of event.
   182
   I was 13 years old at that time when it was my first time to experience very strong winds and heavy rains that made me cry out of fear. It happened last November 8, 2013, in our neighbor's house where we evacuated together with our family. That time, I was afraid and blacked out because of the said incident. I was thinking that time that probably that was the end of my life. Lastly, this particular event stands out among the rest because I could say that it was a life and death situation which involved not only to me but also to my family and more than that it was my first time to experience such event.

   I was 14 years old back then when the strongest typhoon that hit Tacloban City and the rest of Eastern Visayas region. We were able to go to our aunt¡¯s house to be safer. There were so many people under that house, I was with my family, cousin, and friends. I was very scared because it was my first time that I experienced a typhoon like that. I was crying and shouting out for help. This experience stands out the most because it gave me trauma and so many realizations in life. Being resilient after being devastated would probably be the best lesson that I learned. It  could help me to be stronger for the upcoming calamities that will hit us.
   184
   I was 10 years old back then when my brother died because of dengue. When my aunt received a message from my dad telling that my brother died, I didn¡¯t know what to do and I just kept crying because I was not expecting that he will suddenly die because we were happy before he was confined to the hospital and all of us were not expecting it. This experience stands out the most because it has a big impact as it happened to my brother. Until now, when I am reminiscing of what happened or watched a movie when some is dying, I always cry, remembering my brother.
   185
   I was 14 years old at that time when the strongest typhoon hit our town. I live in a mountainous part in our town and we are far from the sea that¡¯s why I did not experience or witness any storm surges but I experienced floods and strong winds that destroyed our house and washed out of our properties. Our house was totally destroyed and we stayed in our grandmother¡¯s house during that time. It was really hard for me because along with me were my old grandparents that we need to protect a newborn baby and my uncle who has Down's syndrome. I felt pity for him during that time because he was already crying since he doesn¡¯t know what¡¯s happening, he was all wet because of the rain and he was asking for food that we can¡¯t give to him at that moment. I was really scared during that time because I don¡¯t know what I shall do and I keep on thinking if it was already the end focus but luckily we survived. I¡¯m somewhat what feeling thankful because it helps us to be stronger and be brave enough to face all other challenges in life.
   186
   I was 13 years old when the strongest typhoon Yolanda hit our place. It was the first time that we experienced such traumatic events. The typhoon was totally a disaster. It destroyed many houses, buildings and it even took the lives of numbers of people. I felt nervous at that time and I was so worried about those people who were close to me. This experienced stands out the most because I thought it was already the end and the typhoon was indeed a strong and powerful one. This experience taught us that we should be prepared at all times and we should learn from our mistakes. If ever it will happen again, we can now ready to face it and we should prepare ourselves for the consequence.
   187
    I was 10 years old back then. I had this experience which I personally considered as the most traumatic event which is an unforgettable sexual experience. My father was involved. I was very afraid of him because he will beat me up if I don¡¯t let him touch my private part.But there¡¯s no rape that happened, only touching. I really cried hard, I can¡¯t even sleep back then. I considered myself brave enough to handle it. Now we are ok. He asked for forgiveness already. I¡¯m ok now, I became braver to face any challenges in life.
   188
   I was 13 years old when typhoon Yolanda happened. In Samar, we experienced a strong wind which caused the trees to fall down after the typhoon. It was November 13, 2013, and our family was involved and also the residents of Calbiga Samar. I was still at a young age when that happened, I was so scared and I just wished that time that the typhoon would not last long. That typhoon stands out the most because it was the first time I experienced such a strong typhoon. Our place was not really hit that much, unlike the other places. So I can say that I am not really traumatic at that time.
   191
   I was 18 years old. Recently I was in some sort of a disastrous event. I¡¯ve learned that I have emotionally destroyed someone in the past without me knowing it until recently. It happened last December when my best friend told me about her past and the person she loves the most. It was me all along, but I ended up with her best friend causing her to experience emotional breakdown for the past 2 years. Much more my best friend has a heart illness that caused to have difficulty in breathing like me but she had worse symptoms. My best friend was very sickly. I recently learned that she sacrificed her emotions for my happiness. And now I¡¯ve learned it all. It always comes into my mind that I¡¯ve hurt her due to my wrong choices is should have followed my heart in choosing her 2 years ago. Now, I¡¯ve done too much damage and it haunts me every time not knowing if she is feeling okay or sad.
   193
   I was about 4 or 5 when my parents took me to the beach, my nanny took hold of me and we went deeper into the ocean and I almost drowned. My parents were with us but they were far away from us, so it made me feel alone and afraid. It stands out because it turned severe when I was reminded of it during the typhoon Haiyan storm surge. Since then, I have been afraid of water and drowning alone. It made me stay away from parties near the water. I haven¡¯t really gone down enjoying myself in those situations since. I think it will affect me in my preference in the future if don¡¯t properly deal with it.
   194
   I was 13 years old when Yolanda happened, and even though we evacuated we were still devastated because of the strong wind and rains that Yolanda brought.  I was with my family and I guess it was 5 o¡¯clock in the morning. We were having some coffee when a strong blow wind breaks the office window. We were so frightened by that phenomena for it was followed by numerous strong wind and heavy rain that is so painful. We separated, we don¡¯t know where to go, we just hid under the board and we just cover ourselves with the blanket. We were so wet, cold and frightened. I thought we would die back then. Thankfully, no one died.
   195
   I was 13 years old when my grandfather died. I was hugging him and suddenly my aunt and I had an argument and because of that grandfather died. At the hospital, I was so depressed and lonely at that time. This experience makes me feel guilty and it helps me also to become a better and independent person. 
   196
   I was 14 years old when I experienced typhoon Haiyan. It was very disastrous at that time. My grandfather that time was sick. The whole family was suffering but not only us but the whole Region 8. It was on November 8. 2013 when typhoon Haiyan struck. First, I felt fear about the things to come and then I was thinking about my friends. 5 years ago, November 8, 2013, 11 am though the typhoon is not yet over, we went to our house because at that time we evacuated to my grandmother¡¯s house. We saw that our house was a total destruction. Time past, we built again. What I learned from that experience is always be ready because we don¡¯t know what the future holds. Being brave for that kind of situation in life was not easy to recover but God has a plan for me, my family and to Tacloban, Region and the community.
   197 
    When I was 16-17 years old maybe, I can¡¯t remember because I prefer to forget any stressful event so that it can¡¯t affect me in my daily activities. It¡¯s when I and my brother and cousin decided to go to the downtown area to find food. It was depressing to see many dead bodies and many families are crying and anxious to find their loved one during the typhoon Yolanda. 
   198
   I was 13 years old back then and the day before it happened was a very sunny day. And when the typhoon came the sky got covered in dark clouds, strong winds whistling along with the rain causing it. It happened on November 8, 2013, the whole Province at Leyte was greatly involved. At that time I thought about what was happening and what was going to happen. This experience stands out the most because it was the first time I¡¯ve ever experienced such calamity. This experience taught me how to be tough and this experience will surely be engraved in my memory since I personally witnessed and survived it myself. 
   200
   I was 14 years old last November 8, 2013, that was the traumatic event that I experienced in my whole life. It happened in all Region 8 which is in Leyte and Samar. All the people who are living in Region 8 was involved in that traumatic event especially me and my family. I thought that I would be dead at that time because I was scared at that time and also my family. This experience I will never forget because it was a memorable event. 
   201
   I was 13 years old, Super typhoon Yolanda struck the Philippines on November 8, 2013, in the Eastern part. My family was involved and so was I. I was thinking when it would stop and I was afraid of what would happen to us specially my family. This was the worst situation we have ever been in our lives. I am brave because after that aftermath, I survived. The role I can play is being a good person with concern for others. In some profession, I can be a doctor who is ready to help. 
   202
   I was 13 years old during that time when super typhoon Yolanda hit Leyte. There was a strong wind, heavy rains and of course lots of calamities occurred during that time and it was very dangerous and scary. There were floods, tsunami, storm surge. The houses were blown away by that devastating calamity. People were in panic during those times, they didn¡¯t know what to do and they didn¡¯t know what things they needed to prepare. They didn¡¯t believe on news. Some reasoned it has never happened before. But then it happened as expected. It was in Leyte as well as in Samar, the people involved are those who were living in that particular area. I felt lonely, scared and hopeless. Yes, this event proved that those people who survived are those that are strong and brave and they can cope with problems even if it¡¯s very risky and it can kill people.
   203
   I was 17 years old when typhoon Yolanda devastated our place. It was a huge typhoon with strong winds and storm surge. No one understood what storm surge was, that¡¯ was why everyone stayed in their houses for we were just comfortable/used to typhoons. Without knowing, that typhoon would leave us helpless, wrecked and damaged. Damaged physically, mentally and spiritually. Thousands of people died, many stores were destroyed. We were like an isolated area. No water, food, electricity and roads were filled with debris. I was with my family that time, actually there were 5 members in my family who were inside the house. I felt so sad and traumatized, I thought that was the end of our life.  But I am grateful to our Almighty God, for the blessings and hope that He gave us. He sent his help through other people for us to be saved and to start our life again. By this experience an unforgettable event, it made me stronger and prepared all the time, and be alert to the unexpected weather that will happened in our life. 
   205
   I was 13 years old when typhoon Yolanda happened. Our house was destroyed by the typhoon and there were many people die. It happened 5 years ago here in Leyte and Samar. I was really afraid that time because I think that was the last day of our lives. In this kind of experience I became braver then. I became more attentive and aware in everything that will happen in the future. 
   207
   I was 18 years old that time, well it was about my parents getting sued because of a debt. I think it was last year, my parents were involved and my mother¡¯s friend whom she was indebted with. I felt depressed of course and worried to what would happen to us and my parents especially that I have two siblings. If I were to analyze this experience the only thing that I could say is that there will be a time that I myself will help my family in overcoming our problems and that is my role as the oldest in the family. 
   208
   I was 13 years old when the super typhoon Yolanda brought disaster to our place. Trees were uprooted and streets were flying as if they are light-weight glasses breaking due to the pressure of the winds and more. I was with my family when it happened. I felt like it was the end of our lives like we didn't expect that it will be that strong. Eventually there are problems that will come into our life, don¡¯t give up.
   209
   I was 14 years old when Typhoon Yolanda happened. Before that, everything was good and I didn¡¯t think that Yolanda would be very strong. The storms before Yolanda, would bring little rain only, no flood, no destruction, etc. The evening of November 7, 2013 we were already on the evacuation center, we listened to the radio. At 4 AM the wind blew hard. Until, 6 AM everything was white and we couldn¡¯t see anything. And there¡¯s was that last blow of the wind. I was with my family during that day. I was so scared, I was thinking how our house and everything were. This was the most traumatic event because I got so stressed and scared when there¡¯s a storm. 
   210
   Transportation accidents happened to me many times in different places and years. But I will share my worst experience. Recently, it was January 7, 2019 that was Sunday and I have my NSTP schedule so I went to school. After how many hours of waiting I decided to go home because our leader was not around. On my way home, I was already at the jeepney I fell asleep for a while until I heard a loud beep from the other vehicle. I woke up and I started to panic because when I woke up the truck hit our jeepney exactly. So I thought I was going to die at that instant. My heart beat so fast and that time it was hard for me to breathe. The only thing in my mind maybe this time, I will die because for how many years of experiencing this kind of situation nothing bad happened to me except for being in panic. On that day, I felt so hopeless because the truck that hit us had no break so the driver was out of control. This experience stands out the most because it happened to me every year. About this experience, it¡¯s telling me ¡°don¡¯t overreact but instead, always be positive and be brave and be alert.¡±
   211
   I was only 15 years old when I witnessed a car accident along Maharlika Highway Tacloban City. The jeepney overtook and the motorcycle break to avoid to hit their vehicle to the jeepney but the driver of the motor didn¡¯t control their vehicle because the speed of his motor is very fast. That motorcycle hit the jeepney so that the man died because his head hit  the jeepney.  The blood flowed into the road. I was shocked and afraid of what I witnessed because it was the worst event that happened in my life. Week after that I always remember the car accident and the motor accident, it¡¯s hard to forget that event because I get reminded of it if I saw a car accident in the television. The experience gives me a lesson to be strong and brave and not to be afraid if the worst event comes to my life because it was an experience and that experience gives a lesson.
   212
   I was 14 years old back then. It was like experiencing so many struggles in just one time. It happened before typhoon Yolanda occurred in our house where we lived,  in Brgy. 76, Fatima Village Tacloban City. My family was involved in it. I felt heartbroken and down about what happened to my that¡¯s ever happened to me. I became a strong person after that circumstance. It taught me a lesson to be a strong person if I face problems again. 
   213
   I was 17 years old this traumatic event happened to me when my father and sister encountered a motor accident in September 2017. I was very sad and worried. I think that this particular experience stands out the most because it involved my family member and I don¡¯t want to lose them. This experience taught me that traumatic event will happen anytime and everywhere. 
   214
   It happened when I was still 13 years old. When strong winds and painful rainfalls hit me during the storm, slowly destroying the house I grew up with. Then murky waters flooded the whole community several meters high. It happened on November 8, 2013 in my hometown, all of us were involved. Feeling nervous and helpless, there was nothing I could do about it. This particular experience stood out the most as it is the one that changed the course of my life. Through this it helped me decide what I really want to become. This experience helped me to treasure the past, make the most out of the present and hope for the future. 
   215
   During that time I was 14 years old, at a very age, I experienced a traumatic scenario. Of course it¡¯s inevitable for us not to experience such calamities. So definitely way back 2013 I encountered a life-changing moment when typhoon Yolanda hit our country and devastated almost all. I was with my family in Carigara, Leyte. During this moment I was very upset and I kept on overthinking things. This event stands out because of its effect to all of us¡¦how we perceive ourselves as part of the society. 
   216
   I caught my father having an affair with someone. I was so stressed and depressed that even my appetite crashed. I was 18 years old back then. It happened last December 2017. It always bothers me that every time I remembered it I always cry and I want to punch my father for what he has done. I decided to stay late on the streets, interacting with addicts and having hard time trusting everyone again. But of course through prayers and acceptance I forgive my father then he promised to us that it won¡¯t happen again. This event plays a very important role in me for the reason that I won¡¯t be able to know that I am brave enough to conquer those sequence and it also taught me that it is not good cheating with your partner. 
   217 (NONE)
   218
   I am 19 years old. It was the time of Yolanda when we were at our grandmother¡¯s house. The glass window was broken by the wind and the roof has been blown away by the storm so the water goes to the chandelier that a little bit more water it would break down and we'd fall on the table. My grandmother was there, my mother¡¯ relatives and my family except for my father because he was in our house. I am scared and thinking the house may be blown away. This stands out because it was the first time I experienced such a strong storm. This experience illustrates how I became more careful and prepared in times of calamities and other unexpected danger. 
   219
   I am 19 years old. During the typhoon, I have a lot of experiences during that time because I felt nervous about the rain and also the wind and the walls of our house broke down. During the typhoon Yolanda. My family was involved at that time but we were not complete in the house that time because we were far from our sister. I thought that was my last day and that was the end of life. I was crying at that time. But God has given me another life to live in this world and to experience how I am important for the future. 
   220
   I was 15 years old when I experienced super typhoon Yolanda at around 5:00-6:00 am. November 8, 2013, I just came from Dagami, Leyte and during that day I and my family evacuated to our neighborhood for us to survive that typhoon. During that day I think that maybe that was my last day because of what happened that day.  It made me feel nervous. This experience stood out the most and this experience helps me realize that I am strong since that day. 
   221
   I was 14 years old when that traumatic experience happened. It was the typhoon that came here in Samar and Leyte. We thought that it was an ordinary typhoon. But it was not, that typhoon caused hundreds of deaths. The lesson I learned out of this experience was a realization to take care of our nature and ourselves as well. Always be ready for a typhoon or tragedy that might happen.  And while you are still alive, get something that makes you happy gives you happy and the people around you.
   222
   I was 9 years old, in my elementary school years, when my father passed away some 10 years ago. He died but we don't know what really happened. It was very difficult not having a father.  When he died, our life started to become miserable.  Now, we aren't happy as a family as we were before. For now, one thing that I like is to finish my studies and to help my mother who supported me in every circumstance in life and to help my 9 siblings. 
   223
   I am 19 years old. I was cooking something when the stove accidentally flared up. It happened a month after Typhoon Yolanda. That time my older sister has just experienced the traumatic event of Yolanda. I was stunned I didn't know what to say to her or if I should run. I was overwhelmed with the fear of burning the house. I don't want to see fear in my sister's face again. She has suffered enough during Yolanda. This experience has taught me to be more careful to avoid a similar situation occurring in the future and what to do when a tragic event happens.
   224
   November 8, 2013 typhoon Yolanda devastated the region VIII where my family and I  experienced the most dangerous typhoon. At that time I thought that it was the end of my life especially that of my family. I felt I was lost, felt that I was the only person who was in terrible place and crowded place. I was really fool that time, the negative manner I was supposed to ignore but they were in my mind. I felt depressed that time like no one could get me to safety. I needed some rest and calm after what the typhoon did to my family. Thousands of people died, hundreds missing including my cousin. We felt poverty and lack of confidence to face reality. We felt like we were floating or our mind was floating. That time I realized that for every problem that we encounter, we need to fight so that there¡¯s no bad things that will happen to our family, specifically to our friends. 
   225
   When I was 14 years old, I was in Grade 9 at that time during Junior High School days. It was August when my father got into an accident. I was surprised but at the same time I just wanted to cry at that time. My father couldn't walk after the accident and then there was an organization in Korea that helped people and my father was one of the beneficiaries. The organization gave my father crutches to help him walk again. At that time, I felt depressed and stressed out. I cried at night and sometimes I couldn't focus on my school activities. When I was at school, I tried not to feel sad, I always smiled and tried to be happy even though I was having a big pain in my heart. After a month, my father was able to walk. But during the time when my father was not able to walk, we were having financial problems because my father was the one who provided for our financial needs since my mother is only a housewife. We were having a hard time and all I wanted to do is to save up some money for myself. Until now, financial problems is the one keep me stressed or depressed sometimes.
   226
   During the typhoon Yolanda I was really shocked about what happened. I was thinking ¡°expect the unexpected¡± because that was like the worst thing ever in my life. I was really nervous and scared at the same time because I was thinking of my family¡¯s safety and also the people around us,  specifically our neighbors. During that typhoon I was thinking also about future or what would my future be after the disaster but with the help of my parents and praying, I got hope back in life. 
   227
   When I was 14 years old, typhoon Yolanda came to our place particularly in Basey, Samar. It is one of the gigantic and dangerous typhoons that had  happened in our place. There were extremely strong winds and rains. Our house had been destroyed and also of our farm, that was our source of income that sustained our daily needs. Back in November 2013, my family, my relatives and I had been suffering that time. I¡¯m very thankful to God for saving our lives, we survived. I learned to be calm and relaxed. 
   228
   When I was 13 years old. My father suffered from a life-threatening illness and I couldn't understand what kind of sickness he has experienced. One night, he asked me where was my mother and told me to call her and my other siblings. When we were all inside the room where my father was lying, I felt nervous and sad as well for I did not know what my father was going to say. Then I was shocked when he said ¡°I cannot do it, I felt tired and I want to rest¡± my tears fell down and couldn¡¯t explain anything. I asked myself did my father suffered much. Is he really going to leave us? By these thoughts, it made me feel unhappy and couldn¡¯t think better because the only thought that stayed in my mind was that father would be leaving or he will die sooner or later. Thankfully, that thing I feared didn¡¯t happen because father is still alive until now. Because God gave him second life and it made me realize that nothing is impossible when you keep on praying and put God in the center of your life. 
   229
   I was 20 years old when that event happened. December 25, 2018, My boyfriend got into motorcycle accident. I felt very sad, stressed, emotionally depressed and traumatized. In that particular experience, I was just very stressed about what happened to my boyfriend.
   230
   When I was 9 years old, I was in my bed together with my mother when my uncle came at the back of our house with a big knife. He was throwing something and it hit in my mother¡¯s head that caused the blood to flow out. My father was very angry and they fought. I was so shocked and was crying when I saw my mother¡¯s head bleeding. This is the event that I don¡¯t want to happen again. This experience taught me how to be brave, be observant to others and do not trust easily. It makes me who I am today, no longer afraid like I used to. It gives me strength and courage to face any situations. 
   231
   Experiencing a traumatic event at a young age is very much difficult to cope with, especially that I was just a twelve-year-old student at that time. In this traumatic event, I have experienced strong blow of winds. Actually, it was very strong to the point that it carried away the roof of many houses. Also, it broke branches, broke down walls, and even uprooted big trees. Even though that event happened about 6 years ago, it still disturbs me in a way that it had caused great damages not only to properties but also to the mental health of my family, relatives, myself and all typhoon Yolanda victims. And being in that situation really created fear towards what natural disaster could bring to someone¡¯s life. Struggles are somehow inevitable. With that, it enables us to respond to such things in our own ways. 
   232
   The most traumatic event that I¡¯ve experienced is last November 8, 2013, the super typhoon Haiyan locally called "Yolanda¡±. It affected mostly the many parts of Leyte. I was 13 years old at that time, and I felt so nervous, afraid and other emotions at that time. I was too "dumped" to notice that everyone in that area was so scared that almost our things, houses, and other important things disappeared. My family and I were praying at that time. After that super typhoon, I was so emotional, even though we were all safe, but we lost all our important things that day. I can say that this particular experience stands out the most because it taught me to be brave  as a person. It also helped me realize that no matter what happens, let God be the center of our lives. With this also I¡¯ve experienced traumatic conditions, and I developed a phobia. I¡¯m sure that this event will not be forgotten in our lives. 
   233
   It happened when I was in High School at the age of 14. This happened when my sister came back home from Manila. It was September then, my father went to Manila to get my two sisters who were working to help us for our financial needs, specially that at that time, there were three of us in the family who were studying. We celebrated their homecoming and then one of my sisters started to have a problem in speaking. She was mumbling something, and she was trying to find a knife and then my father noticed it. Then, she started to shout and all of us in that place started to get nervous. We started to go to different places to look for a specialist. There were also a lot of rituals and herbs she took. My father got bank loans for all those expenses. I felt that I and my sister, we were in our Elementary and High School years,  were not being cared for by my parents. That was the time when I started to become rebellious. All of my grades went down to the limit that I didn¡¯t get any awards during my graduation. It traumatized me because this event will never be gone from us especially that my sister is still having this kind of problem. 
   234
   I was just 13 years old that time, I was a grade 8 student when I experienced super typhoon Yolanda. Before it happened, I and my family was at our house.  We were watching TV  for further news about the typhoon. We were thinking about evacuating because at that time we can¡¯t really imagine how strong it would affect the entire Samar and Leyte. Our uncle who was staying with us because my parents were working abroad, decided not to stay at our house until the typhoon was gone. We evacuated at the nearest School at our Barangay and stayed until the morning. But we were shocked, afraid and I even heard cries from my brothers and sisters and all the people in there. We were not expecting it would happen to all of us. I saw falling debris, trees were swaying, the rain was not normal, there was zero visibility. The roofs of the school were crashed and our things are all wet together with our foods. This was the first time I encountered personally a super typhoon. And it made me think to myself that I should be stronger for myself and to my family.
   235
   I was 18 years old, last year when my best friend¡¯s father was accused as a rapist. One of their neighbors accused him for raping their 11-year-old daughter but according to the medical record, there was no injury on the vagina of the girl and the statement of the girl was not constant or it was inconsistent. Now, my best friend¡¯s father is in jail. I feel very sad because I treat him as my second father. Then, this happened to him, and I really witnessed how my best friend¡¯s family was suffering. Ruining someone¡¯s life is really bad, experiencing this kind of situations would lead to depression, I¡¯m just afraid that maybe one day my best friend will give up. 
   236
   I was 21 years old when my brother was diagnosed with cancer, it was on the month of September since my brother was diagnosed. No one was involved, it was a natural phenomenon that happens to everyone. During that time, I was thinking different outcomes and I felt so worried about it. This experience stood out among other experiences because this changed my family. When someone in the family died, it brings too much sadness to every member. This experience was the worst experience of my past, but an essential experience for the present that is useful for the future in being aware that life and death are not far from each other.
   237
   I was 13 years old back then I was nearly raped by my classmate. It was night time when my father asked me to buy some bread at the bakery. I was nervous that time because it was already dark outside and my brother was not there during that time to accompany me. I was really scared and nervous because I never thought that my classmate would do such a thing like that to me. Luckily my father followed me and he was able to save me from that traumatic event that happened to me that night. But then despite those things, although for some people they would just say that I was just nearly raped, still it has an impact on me every time I saw that classmate of mine what happened to me that night was all in the past but still I can¡¯t forget those things specially that classmate of mine who nearly raped me.
   238 
   The most traumatic event that ever happened to me was the night my father died without me by his side. It was last May 6th year 2016. I was in the gym (event hall)  that night watching the ¡°cultural night¡± in our municipality for the upcoming fiesta since I was a summer job worker, I should be there and suddenly aa text message from my sister came up saying ¡°go home, Tatay (Father) is dead,¡±  I was really shocked and nervous not expecting that message. I left my friends and ran until I reached home. As I entered our house, my aunts and cousins were there crying in my parents¡¯ bedroom, it was my first time seeing my mother crying. And it really broke my heart seeing my father lying in his bed without life. I was crying, really and coming over to my father was purely heartbreak, seeing his eyes closed was devastating for me. Was then 16 years old when that traumatic experience happened but I guess in that very young age, I must have realized to give value to my parents and love them eternally. I¡¯m doing my best for them, even if my father is not with me anymore, I know he¡¯s just up there looking and duding me for every decision I¡¯m making.
   239 
   I was 13 years old when the worst event happened to my family. It was December 16, 2013 when the one whom I considered second mother and my mentor died. I feel so sad, negative and so down it was like there is no hope for tomorrow. I think of the days that my aunt was still alive and having fun with us, I think of the learnings that I¡¯ve got from her. I think of those days that we¡¯ve spent together and I think of the days that I get mad at her and I forget to tell her ¡°thank you¡± and ¡°i love you.¡± This experience stands out the most for it changes my life, it affects my vision in life because my aunt is part of all the dreams that I want to be. She is my inspiration and my model for things that I want to achieve, I always think of her seeing me right now, studying at the same school where she graduated and taking the program that she also took up. This experience gives me strength to keep life going, that whatever tragedy or event that happens, there is still hope that awaits. I think the role of this to my past, present and future is to be as hard as a rock, that no matter how life gets hard and painful, there will be somebody who will come to help you get up. It¡¯s a matter of HOPE, if there is life, there is hope.

   I was 13 years old when Typhoon Yolanda occurred. It was such a devastating typhoon that destroyed all houses even the concrete ones. The storm killed thousands of people in Tacloban due to its force and the misleading information (example the misconception of storm surge). My family and I was in serious fear because it never happened to us in our entire life. This experience stands out the most because it was such a memorable experience that taught us many life lessons. Further, it prepares us to be more aware and be able to cope with the changes in nature. 
   241 
   When I was 13 years old I exactly experienced Super Typhoon Yolanda here in the province of Leyte where we are the people of this province suffered from a strong typhoon that killed a lot of people. Just like in Tacloban City. In addition, Super typhoon Yolanda destroyed many buildings, houses and many more. This experience caused trauma to me as victim of this natural disaster. This experience also tells me that despite this, we should continue our dreams in life, thinking positive and motivate myself to become strong. 
   242 
   I was in fifth grade way back in my elementary times and I was 11 years old at that time, in our Barangay (community). I, together with my younger brother and younger sister were inside our house alone and we were in the living room at that time when suddenly there was a loud ¡°bang¡±. I thought it was just a normal accident but it was not. A fisherman dealer standing in front of our house was hit by a bus that was running very fast. The man was thrown away while he was inside his tricycle and then the tricycle was thrown near our door. The gasoline was leaking. I called my brother and my sister to stay out of the door and run outside through the backdoor because I thought that the tricycle would explode because of the gas leaking.
   243
   I was 14 years old when it happened, Typhoon Yolanda. It happened in Leyte last November 8, 2013, six years ago. I, my family and those close to me, as well as everyone in Leyte, Samar and Tacloban were involved in this. I was worried and thought ¡°Can I survive this?¡± While I was crying. I felt sad and irritated why it happened to us that year. I think this particular experience is unforgettable because it caused me to feel restless. I kept on saying and praying to God to protect me and my family, to survive, because I have more plans in my life and I just want to come back and help and support my family after studying.

   245 
   I was 14 years old at that time when I felt that it was the end of my life. Typhoon Yolanda hit Eastern Visayas. During that time, my parents and I had experienced that nostalgic catastrophe in my entire human life. People were trying to find a safe place to hide from the strong winds. At that very moment of my life my parents would have to tell us that no matter what happened we will stay beside them. Upon hearing that statement I felt hopeless and I blamed myself for not taking care of the environment. Indeed this catastrophe always bothers my mind whenever I feel depressed solving the problems in my life. I should thank God for everything.
   246
   I was 19 years old. I¡¯m having difficulty to let go of whom I¡¯ve never met him . I want that this won¡¯t happen again to me. I already asked for my little brother. But I am thankful that he always let me out of him. I feel so unaware with a person who intends to abuse me even though I don¡¯t  know his identity.  I think I will forget the past so that it won¡¯t bother me again. I will always pray for God to keep those sadness from happening again. I¡¯ll forget it all if I learn how to let go. I conclude that forgetting all the past will be the better than to let yourself be depressed. Always praying is the best weapon.
   247 
   When my stepdad died 3 years ago, I was only 17 that time he died because of stomach cancer. Seeing him suffer everyday made me feel sad and anxious about his health. My parents had been constantly fighting because of financial problems everything changed since we found out that he had cancer. At an early age I had to keep that pain in my heart everyday, it troubled me because I am not sure if my dad will still be with us or will give up and leave us. That experience stood out the most because from that event many stressful things have followed. Many problems challenged me and my family, challenges that I knew will make me strong in the future. 
   248
   When I was about to turn 18 - July 2010 - when my dad told me.
   249
    I was 18. Someone touched my leg inside the motorcab. I was afraid because it was my first time. 
   250 
   I was 13 years old that time when super typhoon Yolanda hit our place. We¡¯ve experienced difficulty. We¡¯ve suffered a lot, specially with regards to food, water, etc that will help us survive that time. During the typhoon, 6 families evacuated to our house. They came over at our house because they thought that our house was strong, hard to destroy. Luckily we survived that time and we¡¯re very thankful because of the help from others. And specially we were very thankful to God because we are alive and we survived. I think that this particular event stands out the most because this is the very first time we experienced the storm surge and it scared me a lot. I think this experience says about who I am, that I am brave enough to face difficulties in life. 
   251
   I was 14 years old when Typhoon Yolanda devastated Tacloban. November 8, 2013 in Tacloban. The people in Tacloban. I felt nervous and afraid. This is the most unforgettable experience for me because my family and I were in between life and death. During Yolanda, I realized that I¡¯m a strong person when family is involved. Through I¡¯m afraid but I trusted God totally that time. Yolanda serves as a lesson that we need to always be ready, aware, knowledgeable about what is happening in our environment, in the earth. Today people know how to be sensitive to information that we receive. People should be aware, like what I¡¯ve said, knowledgeable when it comes to natural disasters that might happen. We need always to be ready at all times in all places. 
   252
   In November 8, 2013, I was 19 years old at that time, I was at the house of my uncle, because they are the ones supporting my studies. It was a rainy morning. The house was being destroyed totally by the string winds and rains. I was only thinking to save important things for them, without thinking safety. But after a minute, I got worried with my family because they were near the river. The coconut trees fell in the direction of our house. The volume of water increases immediately, the electric posts crumbled down. I was shocked, nervous, afraid, I was thinking what would happen to us after that tragedy. Our house was destroyed, the source of income of my parents were gone. I also thought about my older sister who was in Tacloban. I cried because we didn¡¯t know what happened to her. And I realized that things in this world are just temporary, even life is just temporary. I prayed and cried to God to say sorry. I felt that it was the end of my life. Even a very light run, storm, when the wind blows, I was always thinking about the past experience during Yolanda. I feel having a little but of trauma with the string winds, specially if I am outside the house. 
   253
   The traumatic event that I have experienced was the super typhoon Yolanda. I was 15 years old that time . It was a very unexpected event that happened in my life. i was so very shocked not only me but also my whole family. It happened at home early in the morning. my whole family was sleeping at that time. We were together when that happened. We were all shocked at that situation because it came so suddenly. We didn¡¯t know what to do, we were trying to think of the best solution to save our lives because we needed to survive. I was thinking to myself from that situation that I am a strong person because of what happened. I stand as a strong person, that I can fight the good life. The past is more about bad memories, sadness, difficulties and challenges from that experience but it helped me prove that I am a strong person.
   254
   I was 18 years old at that time. My papa (father) was drunk and he would always argue with my mother. Then my younger brother told me that suddenly papa got a knife and threatened to stab my mom. I do not remember at all how it happened in our house, and my brother was the only one who witnessed it. That time, my brother shared it with me. I was shocked because never in my entire life that my papa will do that because out of the 6 children, we didn¡¯t experience being spanked by my papa, so I couldn¡¯t believe it. This experience stands out the most because my papa don¡¯t do that, this experience say about who I am because I¡¯m papa¡¯s girl and I cannot accept the fact he threatened my mama. 
   255
   I was thirteen years old at that time. We were in bed when my cousin knocked our door and told my parents that my uncle was shot by a gun. I was at the second floor when I overheard their conversation. I was feeling nervous at the same time extremely sad. I was thinning of the plans that my uncle made for us. I wanted to g to him but my parents didn¡¯t allow me to. I think this event stands out the most because we were so close to each other and it saddened me because he would no longer be there to fulfill his plans and promises. I think I always cherish and protect the people around me because I don¡¯t know when they will last. I wanted him to see me grown and witness my achievements.
   256
   I was 16 years old way back in 2016. I was assigned or elected as an officer in our school. That position has a very enormous role. Everyone was expecting greater things from me knowing that I came from a family that excels when it comes to this thing. However, there was this task that I failed to accomplish because of a much greater thing to do. So instead of hearing me out, they judged me and spread harsh comments about me. I felt so depressed that time knowing that nobody seemed to listen to me. That¡¯s why I got to the point f stopping school just is I can ignore all of there judgments. I even jumped or attempted to cut my life out because of the fear and pain that disturbed me a lot. I still have this now, I just learned how to manage it and hide it from them.
   257
   I was thirteen years old when the super typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines especially in Tacloban City. I experienced how strong and devastating that typhoon was, many houses were destroyed, many lives were gone. Our barangay drowned in flood because of the ¡°storm surge.¡± November 8, 2013, when the typhoon hit Tacloban City. It involved me and my family. I was thinking how to survive that kind of phenomenon. I hope and pray that no one be harmed especially me and my family. For me this the most devastating experience that I¡¯ve ever encountered. It makes me who I am because I am afraid that maybe there¡¯s a bad thing that will happen to me and my family. For me the role of the past will help me to my future to beware and be prepared and also to overcome the fear.
   258
   I was 21 years old when the unforgettable trauma happened to me. That was then typhoon Yolanda that caused me a traumatic experience way back in November 2013 in Marabut, Samar. No one was exempted of that natural disaster. All people in Marabut were victims and for me this was the most embarrassing experience in my 26 years of living in this world. We only live once and I think we need to enjoy every minute of our lives together with the presence of our God.
   259
   I was 14 years old, one of the traumatic events happened in my life, the Yolanda storm hit in Leyte. I was feeling depressed when Yolanda caused our place to vanish. One event in particular was when my Lola or grandmother couldn¡¯t walk anymore, we needed to move her to a safer house. At that situation, my hear was beating fast. 
   260
   I was 15 years old during that time. I was in the middle of my sleep. It was actually dawn when I felt someone kissing me, then that was the time I woke up, it happened in our house, my own brother was the main person who was involved. I felt nervous, scared, anxious and bad.
   261
   I was 14 years old when the event happened. It was the Yolanda typhoon specifically. It was really unexpected since the night before the typhoon it was very great. There were many stars and we were just watching TV calmly at home. I thought it was the show ¡°Genesis¡± in GMA network. I slept well that night, but when the morning came, I felt my surroundings moving. I thought that was a normal wind shaking our house. But slowly it became stronger until we heard a lot of roofs flying. I haven¡¯t had breakfast that time because we immediately moved to another house because we didn¡¯t feel Sade in our house. Then, later on, everything turned white. There was also that creepy sound up above the sky. Then the wind as well as the rain was painful. I didn¡¯t know what to do. I wanted to cry but I wanted to stay strong. Everyone in my family and neighbors was there, thy were also worried. It was the scariest moment. Even to my parents, it was their first time to experience something like that. When the white surroundings were gone, we then realized that our house was already down, and when we went to the backyard, we saw coconut trees down. It seemed very wide to see since everything was down. We saw even the mountain from far away. At that time, I thought we were the only survivors, but good to know that they were also safe. After that day, there were fake news that a tsunami was coming. Everyone felt alert and alarmed again but I said to myself, ¡°why tsunami?¡± Tsunami will only occur if there¡¯s an earthquake and we were 10 kilometers away from the shore. So I wondered why people reacted that way. Maybe it was the trauma about what happened the previous day. Then there was another rumor about the tsunami, LOOTING followed the next day and it actually helped us since we didn¡¯t have food for that week. 
   262 
   I have only become fully aware about sexual harassment when I entered college. I have learned when and how it happens or like how one could say it was sexual harassment, but back in senior high school when I was 17 years old, I had some hints already about how it could happen. There were a lot of instances my friends were being harassed. There would be times when a random man would grab and hold their thighs when they¡¯re in the public transport. And now in college it got worse. Some would take advantage when my friend was asleep in her apartment. This happens because her roommate lets her guy friends in sometimes. It makes me very worried about my friend¡¯s emotional state. I also feel angry towards men mostly because they couldn¡¯t control their sexual feelings. I think it says that I am am protective person because even it doesn¡¯t affect me directly, knowing it bothered someone I care about also makes me feel sad and angry.
   
   263
   I was 14 years old, the super typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan), we were at our house in Tacloban City with my family and relatives. I felt scared, so scared that it felt like I was going to die at that time. This one stands out for me because that typhoon was recorded as the world¡¯s strongest typhoon. This experience made us strong that we survived that devastating typhoon. I think my past experience taught me to be brave, strong now in the present and for the future to come. 
   264
   When I was 14 years old, there was a typhoon called Haiyan. It was 6 AM we experienced a heavy rainfall and strong winds. After sometime my parents and aunt decided to evacuate but the water level started to rise so we stayed at our neighbor¡¯s house. All the other neighbors were there too, the water level continued to get higher and we were alarmed because there were lots of children who couldn¡¯t swim. I felt scared to die that time so we prayed  with my neighbors and we thanked God that the level of water went down.
   265
   I was 18 years old when super typhoon Yolanda hit the province of Leyte. It was the most traumatic event I ever had. November 8, 2013, many people were involved specially me and my family. I felt sad and it made feel fear of death. This experience taught me how to be responsible anytime and it gave me hint about who really I am. This experience gave me a lesson that whatever you do, whatever happens to you, you need to stand up no matter what.
   266
   I was 18, and got injured while playing basketball. I thought I was gonna die. I was with my friends at that time. They were involved. 
   267
   I was 18 when a motorcycle accident happened. October 31st 2018 in Mayorga, Leyte with my friends. I was scared thinking about me and my friends, we were in danger. I was also scared thinking about the reaction of my family because that motorcycle accident put my life in danger. I got big wounds in my arms and back, a dislocated bone in the ankle. The role of this accident in my life is to be more careful of myself when we are on the road.
   268
   I was 20 years old, my cousin got hit by the bus. I don¡¯t exactly remember the date or I just forget it. It happened in my hometown, Visares, Leyte. I and my cousin were together that day. I was shocked at that happening. I think this was the most shocking event that ever happened to me and it made me realize that I easily get shocked and scared.
   269
   I think I was 14 years old when I experienced a strong typhoon. My grandmother and my sister evacuated to my aunt¡¯s house on the third floor. But my mom and dad did not evacuate because they had obligations to do. My mom was a barangay chairwoman and she needed to find out if other families have not evacuated yet. In that situation, I saw my mom and dad walking in the street when the typhoon started. I saw many roofs flying everywhere and they were almost hit. I cried because I was watching both of them. But after that they came to my aunt¡¯s house and were kept safe. But then we were shocked when the windows broke and my mom was hurt. I didn¡¯t know what to do but to cry thinking that it might be the last day of our lives.
   270
   I was 13 years old that time when my mother left us, she went to Manila then there she found a new husband. Because of what happened, I and my sibling decided to stop school because we lost interest of studying, feeling stressed asking why it happened to us. But at the end of the day, I realized that it happened for a reason, it was then that I truly accepted it. This experience made me independent. This experience reminds me to be strong all the time, to have faith in God and I make this experience as my inspiration to rich my ambitions. 
   271
   It was November 8, 2013, we were in Alang-alang, Leyte when Yolanda made its landfall in Leyte. I was 15 years old back then, old enough to know what was happening around. Heavy rainfall, string winds, crying people, running around to seek safe places.  I would never forget that most tragic experience in my life. After the landfall, I have witnessed chaos, so much structures got broken.
   272
   I was 17 years old, I have experienced being assaulted by a drunk man who was about 30-40 years old already, I was walking on the street of Alang-alang when suddenly someone called me but I didn¡¯t look since I didn¡¯t know that person, then that person got angry and started shouting at me but still I didn¡¯t look back until he threw stone at me. Then I looked back with anger in my face, I guess the man was insulted that¡¯s why he stood and run towards me with a knife. I didn¡¯t know what to do I just stood, he attempted to stab me with the knife but I dodged it then he slips and let go of his knife. But still he caught me and punched me and kicked me. His friends stopped him and he was reported to the authorities. It stands out as the worst because it was the time when I was so happy because it was my birthday but that sad event happened. 
   273
   It happened when I was 17 years old. The storm surge came to our island. The  water came from the sea. It took many lives of my neighbors and also my grandmother¡¯s life. A lot of people in my community suffered that day. I felt scared, hopeless, and all negative thoughts came to my mind. But my mind said that it¡¯s not the right time to think those negative thoughts. I thought that I can survive, we will survive. This experience tells me that I¡¯m a strong person, never give up.
   274
   I was 15 years old that time when Yolanda happened and affected our hometown Jaro, Leyte. I was with my family. That day, I was shocked because many houses in the community were destroyed and I also cried that time. This experience was a very memorable moment in my life. People had a hard time during Yolanda.
   275
   I was already 14 years old back in November 8, 2013. We experienced Typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan. That time, I was with my family in my hometown in Palo, Leyte. When the typhoon started, we didn¡¯t expect that it was going to be the worst of worst. Our house slowly sank in the water and we were being pushed away by the strong current. There were falling and flying debris like wood, roof. That time I thought that was the end of my life. I was so afraid I didn¡¯t know what to do. I was praying to God to out an end to that sorrowful thing that was happening to us.
   276
   I was 14 years old when typhoon Yolanda happened. I and my family evacuated to the nearest evacuation center like the church. We planned to stay there after the typhoon. At that time, we felt how strong the typhoon was by the sound of the winds and what was happening outside. In the meantime, we remembered our dad was in our house near the sea. I couldn¡¯t understand my emotion. I felt scared about my dad. We didn¡¯t know what to do. My little sisters were crying because they were scared about the typhoon and dad was not with us. I didn¡¯t know what happened by my brother got injured in his legs. Because we tried to evacuate again to the safest place or the highest place. We stayed there and waited for the typhoon to get calm. Around 10 am we saw dad got injured and we helped him.  The experience about typhoon Yolanda helps me to trust God and to be brave.
   277
   When I was 14, I experienced typhoon Yolanda and this was the most traumatic experience that I ever had. My dad tried to close our  glass window but it broke. It hurt my dad, there was a lot of blood. I was in a situation that I don¡¯t know what I was going to feel that day. I and my family were worried and we prayed and prayed. This experience stood out the most because this was the first time that I saw many people cried and begging for help but no one could help them. This experience made me stronger than before. 
   278
   I was 14 years old when this traumatic event happened. That was November 8, 2013 my whole family, friends, involved in the typhoon. All the people from Eastern Visayas experienced typhoon Yolanda. That time, I felt sad because my whole family needed help.
   279
   I was about fourteen years of age when Yolanda started to hit Tacloban City. That was November 8, 2013 striking all the people of Visayas. My family was involved during that time and other relatives who were very close to me. In that particular time, I was very devastated because we watched the television and we saw lots of people died during the typhoon, specifically in Tacloban City. I also felt sad because tons of people were trying to get help to survive. I think this particular experience stands out the most because it really caused tragic, traumatic, unforgettable experience in some people¡¯s lives, specially to my family. I thought that experience was a thief because it stole lives unexpectedly and we didn¡¯t know when or where it will come and attack. That¡¯s why, I always pray to God that we are in good health always.
   280
   The event happened when I was 14 years old, the time when the flood came during super typhoon Yolanda in my aunt¡¯s house next to us where all of my family were there. I was thinking on when will that tragic moment stop, and all that time I felt nervous. This event taught me not to give up despite the experience I personally witnessed that even if you are struggling hard on your problem, there will always be people who will help you.
   281
   I was 14 years old when this traumatic event happened. Typhoon Yolanda fell into the city. We already evacuated in the place where my papa (father) works near San Juanico Bridge. We evacuated because we thought we could be safe there because it was a high place. I was with my family and relatives who were close to me.  When it was happening, I felt nervous, scared and hopeless because of the strong winds that hit and shook our roof. This experience is unforgettable and survival because it destructed many lives and because of this I can say that I am a strong person that no matter what happen just have faith in God and the rain will stop.
   
   282
   I was 14 years old at that time when super typhoon Yolanda hit our locality in Balangiga Eastern Samar. It was a very bad and the worst experience in my whole life. I was with my family at that time. I was with my mother while my nephew was with my father. Actually I really don¡¯t know how to describe my feelings. I felt we wouldn¡¯t survive that incident because even my parents had lost their strength and motivation to surpass that tragic event.
   283
   I was 14 years old. In the middle of the night, a man asked me to give my phone to him. I was alone. I felt and thought that it was gonna happen again. Actually it was the first time it ever happened to me that¡¯s why it stood out the most. Even right now, I can¡¯t forget what happened that day.  Realized that u should be aware of my society. 
   I was not here when Yolanda hit Tacloban City but when after a few months I visited tacloban City, I felt pity because of what I¡¯ve seen. There are many people who died and suffered, there were still bodies that weren¡¯t recovered. My relatives experienced Yolanda and they shared with me what they¡¯ve experienced and it makes me cry.
   284
   I was 14 years old. I and my family experienced Typhoon Yolanda. It was the worst feeling ever. When I encountered that super typhoon Yolanda, my gather and my brother were in danger because the wall of our home collapsed. And that was the thing that I will never forget and  it was my worst feeling ever in my whole life. And these events happen for a reason because of this I realized the important people of my life and that was my family.
   
   285
   I was 19 years old the the incident happened. It was 4 PM when I carried my nephew who was about a year old. Then suddenly I slipped on the floor causing the two of us to fall. My nephew cried and cried because his left hand hit hard on the floor. But thank God he wasn¡¯t fractured. I felt like I was the worst baby sitter ever.
   286
   I was 14 years old at altho time, when I woke up I heard the wind was whistling so loud. It happened on November 8, 2013, and I was at my father¡¯s place in Tabango, Leyte. At that time, it seems my mind was blocked I didn¡¯t know what to do and how I could defeat those struggles I experienced.
   287
   When I was 14 years old Typhoon Haiyan struck Tacloban City. It was a very strong typhoon. We prayed before the typhoon because we were so scared, so that no one would die in that typhoon. Thank God we were all safe.
   288
   I was 13 years old at that time and I knew that there was a typhoon coming but I didn¡¯t know that it would be that strong. It was around 5 am and the strong winds woke me. I was at my house with my family. And I was very nervous and worried because the winds blew stronger and I was thinking and wishing that it ended immediately. It stands out beaus it was the strongest typhoon that I¡¯ve ever encountered, so strong that it wrecked our house.
   289
   I was 18 at that time,  and my friends were drunk then we decided to stroll around when three strangers confronted us as if they wanted trouble. Some of our comrades decided to fight since some of our friends were girls, then suddenly we found out they had knife. We decided to fight with them and get out of trouble. This experience stands out the most because it can cause harm to my comrades and death at worst. I can tell that I am a critical thinker, that I mist take consideration of all possible consequences. In this experience it tell me to be calm at all times and be careful of the actions that I¡¯m going to do. Then I must be selfless to cared of the others and for their well-being.
   290
   I was 13 years old that particular day when my family land opponent threatened us in our own farm and my mom shouted for me to run. I directly went to a bushy area and hid there. Then suddenly I saw a venomous snake (Philippine cobra) close to me and acted to bit me. I panicked and fortunately I was able to escape but it left me traumatized and depressed.
   291
   I was 20 years old at that time when the super typhoon Yolanda struck Region 8. It was devastating, leaving a lot of casualties, lives were lost, homes were destroyed, people where shocked of the aftermath. It was 6 years agin November 8, 2013 when typhoon Yolanda struck Region 8 very hard. During that time, we were forced to evacuate to our grandma¡¯s house built with steel and cement. We were blessed although the house was partially damaged but still it could still be used. That time, I was particularly alert and awake for things the may happen, like falling objects coming from the sky or debris from the house itself. It was my first time to experience a very devastating typhoon, unlike the other typhoons which only caused flood. But this was far more superior that the previous typhoons. A lot of people died and it was shocking and we couldn¡¯t believe it at first hearing it from people who were from the actual site of the flood/tsunami like water. After the event it made me realize that the good thing you have now,  will probably be gone tomorrow, because natural events are unpredictable although we can plan about how we will handle things after.
   292
   During Typhoon Ruby, I think I was 17, in high school. The eye of the typhoon was at San Policarpo Eastern Samar which is our municipality and it happened on the month of June. I and my family were involved. During that time, I thought only of my sisters who were too young to experience such calamity. It made me thunk that this particular experience stands out the most because it made me stronger and matured enough to be the big brother, or eldest son of the family.
   293
   When I was 16 years old my friend accidentally died, I felt losing interest and I didn¡¯t want to do anything whenever I thought about that friend. I would cry and would remember the tragic events that happened to my friend. After two years, I realized that I should just accept what happened. 
   294
   When I was 16 years old, Typhoon Yolanda happened. It was on November 2013. I was scared that time. Because of that typhoon  many people were scared too. People panicked and they didn¡¯t know what to do.
   295
   I was 15 years old, November 2013, when Typhoon Yolanda struck. We evacuated away from the seashore. I was together with my family and friends. We felt sad that time even though no in in our town died that day, but because of the loss of basic needs like electricity, shelter, and fuel. After the typhoon, we somehow felt happy because the cooperation of all the people in our town was remarkable.
   296
   I was 16 years old when Typhoon Yolanda made its landfall in Tacloban City. That time I was in Calbiga, Samar. The winds were strong, although there was no flooding, there were landslides and trees falling down because of the furious winds. Our house was destroyed. I would never forget this experience of typhoon Yolanda. It¡¯s stuck in my mind.
   297
   I was 19 years old when Typhoon Yolanda happened and struck Eastern Visayas. It made us so scared of the typhoon and it also made us depressed and sad especially that our house was broken because of the strong winds. The trees fell into our house.
   298
   I was 14 years old that time when Typhoon Yolanda came. I was in my home and I experienced strong winds, falling trees and destroying my neighbors¡¯ houses. That time I thought it was our last day love because my house was surrounded by coconut trees and I thought that if they fell down to our small house, we couldn¡¯t make it and we couldn¡¯t go outside.
   299
   I was 16 years old when it happened, Typhoon Yolanda struck us in 2013. I was in San Jose Tacloabn City with my family and neighbors. I was thinking that I was going to die. After the typhoon it changed me, I realized we shouldn¡¯t underestimate mother nature.
   300
   I was 18 years old, it happened here in our city. It was typhoon Yolanda. It landed early in the morning I was so nervous that time but it¡¯s got a lot of good and bad memories and a lot of lessons.
   301 
   I was 21 years old that time, Typhoon Yolanda, it happened here in Tacloban City with my family. I was thinking positive that time, thinking good. 
   302
   I was 16 years of age when I and my family experienced a super typhoon. I and my family thought that we were gonna die and not going to survive that tragedy and I realized from now on that I am a strong survivor.
   303
   I was 15 years old when the strongest typhoon hit Tacloban. We were living in Barangay San Jose, Burayan Tacloban City on November 8, 2013. During that time, me, my aunt and cousins never thought about how devastating event that was coming for us. At 5 AM (if I remember correctly) the wind in Tacloban was too strong and an unfamiliar noise was being heard everywhere. It was a combination of the sound of a flying plane and shouting of people. After that, I was scared because I felt that something was happening while I seeing how the water was quickly rising in a minute into our house, right then, the first floor of our house was covered with water so we went to the second floor and waited for at least half an hour until the water dried out. After that I heard so many people crying calling their dead loved ones. I thought that we were so lucky to live but inside me I was also crying.
   304
   I was 18 years old, on April 6, 2018, when one of our family members, my grandmother committed suicide. It was very very sad, I can¡¯t explain or express what I felt that day because the day it happened was my graduation day in my senior high school. Lola (Grandmother) dies early in the morning. She was a religious person so we didn¡¯t expect that she could do that. It¡¯s killing me inside every time I remember that, because I was the one who witnessed it. Everyday, early in the morning, like 3 AM, I¡¯d suddenly  wake up and then I remember that day when I saw my Lola (grandmother), as if I¡¯m out of my mind, lots of negative thoughts but it keep it to myself.
   305
   I was 15 years old when it happened . I witnessed it with my family at my own town. I felt so down at that time after it happened but I never gave up. If ever it will come back again, just think positive as always.
   306
   When that traumatic event happened, I was 14 years old. During that time, my grandfather told us to evacuate to my Aunt¡¯s house to make sure that we are safe. We decided to go there because our house was not enough to cover or protect our family. That time, I felt so nervous and as curious on what was going to happen. After that happened, it set me to be aware and responsible enough fo being part of society because when it happened every individual knew how to handle things to make it better and we also learned to value things in different situations. 
   307
   When I was 14 years old, Typhoon Yolanda has brought a disaster in our place it traumatized us. Although I was safe, the after effect of Yolanda was the main reason I was traumatized back then. I live in Tanauan, Leyte and I live in Barangay San Miguel. My grandparents has a huge house in which we were there in the second floor with out neighbors. It was truly terrifying and all I could think of was ¡°what would have happened to the people outside?¡± I didn¡¯t know why but u was pretty calm inside but alert and aware outside. This experience stood out because I was traumatized everyday of anxiety, depression and scarcity or extreme living conditions. I think right now I am more aware if what to do and what I am willing to sacrifice.
   308
   I was 14 years old. I encountered or experienced the strongest typhoon that ever landed in the Philippines that caused heavy destruction. It was November 8, 2013 in Dagami, Leyte, the people involved were my family. I was thinking about the destruction in our house and I felt afraid that time. It stands out the most because it was life threatening and I was not expecting that typhoon was very strong. Maybe this experience gave an idea of how I survive and stand as a real survivor that tells that I am strong. The role of this experience tony past, present and future is it will give hope and gives us a lesson for what we did from the past, because it¡¯s still people¡¯s fault why it happened.  
   309
   14 years old. Roofs were flying up. The house that we were staying almost collapsed, nearby houses broke down, wet and cold bodies due to the rain, kneeling down asking Lord for protection. We were in my father¡¯s sister¡¯s house in our hometown together with my family and my aunt¡¯s family. I was afraid we might all die, I was afraid that my other relatives couldn¡¯t survive. I was afraid that my beloved hometown will be completely washed out. It stood out because of too much sadness fear and helplessness to us. It just showed that I am no match for this kind of disaster, no matter how brave I am, I still cried in fear. It taught me to live my life and the people around me and always look up to the Almighty.
   310
   I was 19 years old that time. It was 5 AM, when super typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan started. We went to the bathroom to hide and it was very tight during that time. 
   311
   I was exactly 15 years old during that time when my relatives experienced super typhoon Yolanda in Basey at exactly 7:00 am.
   312
   I was only 16 years old by that time when Super Typhoon Yolanda hit our hometown (Tacloban City). We were not totally informed and we didn¡¯t have any clue that ¡°storm surge¡± might hit our area (near the seashore). Were were located at the school building which is one kilometer away from the sea. I and my family had a very traumatic experience that day. I was thinking too much that time. I almost thought giving up when we were almost drowning. But when I saw a two-two-story building begin where we were located, I found hope. I thanked God for giving us a second life. I thanked him for saving us. 
   313
   I was 20 years old when it happened. It was a super typhoon that landed in  our place here in Tacloban City. We didn¡¯t expect that it was very strong, it was the worst feeling to experience. It was on November 8, 2013 and those who are involved are the victims of Yolanda. That day I felt that we couldn¡¯t survive because everything that we had were lost, our house, we had not eaten that time, we didn¡¯t know where to start again. We fell down again from the beginning. This experience stood out the most because despite all the experiences of that super typhoon Yolanda, we are still here making us strong in spite of all the struggles that we experienced. This bad experience made us strong it made us realize that life is full of disasters. We need to be strong and face the reality and I am proud that I am a victim and survivor of Typhoon Yolanda. 
   314
   I was 15 years of age when I experienced Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan).  Leyte and its neighboring regions suffered so much from this typhoon. People in Tacloban City and nearby places were devastated and became homeless. I thought that there was no one to die in this typhoon. Here in the Philippines, specifically in Eastern Visayas, we are prone to typhoon so I didn¡¯t expect that the typhoon will go this wild. After the typhoon I¡¯ve seen people screaming, finding searching their loved ones and a city full of garbage. I felt that time it was the worst place I¡¯ve ever been in my life. This particular experience stood out the most because everyone suffered from this typhoon. This experience taught myself to look for the silver lining in the scenario, made myself braver than ever. This experience was really important because of this a lot of people not just me, it taught us how to be stronger in each calamity, to pray to our Almighty God the father. It helped us to manage ourselves and not to lean on the things we had because life is short and death is sure, sin is the cause, Christ is the cure. 
   315
   I was 15 years old when it happened. It was so difficult because we had nothing to eat. It was a tearful experience because it was my first time to experience it. It was made worse knowing that your close friends lost their family. There were no transport, the roads were blocked by debris. I was in Samar. I couldn¡¯t explain the feeling when you had nothing, you lost interest in things but that you had to fight no matter what kinds of disasters are on the way. As long as you live you can accomplish things and you have hope. 
   316
   When I was 10 years old, I experienced hardships I my family. I experienced extreme poverty with little to no money to buy food. Despite this, I still had to study so I can help improve our lives. I also experienced troubles and misunderstandings in the family. As the days went by, despite all these hardships, all the more that I want to improve my life and be able to help my family and fulfill their dreams for me. 
   317
   I was 15 at that time, when Typhoon Yolanda landed and left disastrous and dramatic scene. I still remember that it was early in the morning when it started destroying properties, lives and everything. It happened when I was in my hometown, Dagami. I was with my family. I was so thankful that I and my family were together. I was really nervous, it was really chilling, an unforgettable experience. I was praying for our safety. I was calling God to protect us and I offer my life for whatever happened to us. We were thankful that we were safe. Then I promised to myself to change and do good and live my life to its fullest.
   318
   Back in my elementary days, I think 7 or 8 years old . I had an accident that caused me to have dislocation on my right hand. After a year or months I also had another accident which caused a wound that exposed the bone. I was really shocked and was crying the whole time. Actually I have a lot of traumatic experiences I guess but I can¡¯t tell all because I¡¯m running out of time or all are history. 
   319
   I can feel trauma during typhoon Yolanda because some of the houses were destroyed by the typhoon and the power line is also destroyed and the road is very flooded at that time. I was 17.
   320
   When I was 19, a super typhoon (Haiyan) Yolanda devastated the lands not only of Tacloban, but the whole region. As a resident of the city, we are informed about how strong the typhoon is to hit the lands, but not totally informed about what had happened so we just stayed in our house, that is just less than a hundred meters away from the sea. To wrap things ups we were caught-off-guard by this nature related tragic event, that almost took our lives. For me this is so unforgettable because of the lessons we have learned.
   321
   I was 15 years old at that time, it was Christmas and my older sister was busy to cook some food for the ¡°noche buena¡± (Christmas Eve Dinner), kit only happened in our house. My youngest brother came home and got some food, specifically the friend chicken wings and he gave it to my nephew who was just 3 months old. After only a few minutes, my nephew was in danger because the food he ate was definitely not fit for his age. We were not calm and didn¡¯t know what to do, we were worried a lot. We brought him to the hospital because he was under critical condition. After a few weeks, my nephew was getting better and we could see his smile again. Thanks to the Almighty God, we were blessed and very thankful that He gave second life to my nephew.
   
   322
   
   I was 15 years old, I¡¯ve experienced the strongest typhoon. It exactly happened last November 8, 2013. I¡¯m with my family that time. We were so scared and expecting that we all survive. The particular experience stands out the most because it was a traumatic event that we experienced. This experience taught me to never give up in every difficulty that you face in your life. 
   323
   I was 14 years old, I¡¯ve experienced and witnessed the super typhoon Yolanda. It was exactly happened last November 8, 2013, I¡¯m with my family that time. We were so scared and we were not expecting to survive. This experience stands out the most because this was the traumatic event I¡¯ve ever experienced. 
   324
   I was 16 years old, it happened during Super Typhoon Yolanda. Our house was ruined by the strong wind and heavy rain, my family did not prepare to evacuate because we thought that it will not cause damage to out house and the worst was we did not prepare to pack out things, because we thought it¡¯s just like the other typhoons that usually pass by Leyte. We did not watch the news. I was thinking that time how we were to survive because my parents lost their farm. But then we were able to stand up again by helping each other.in
   325
   I was 16 years old that time, Ive experienced the disastrous Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). That happened last November 8, 2013. I was with my family that time. We were so scared and we were not expecting that time to survive. This particular experience stands out the most because this was the traumatic event I¡¯ve experienced. This experience taught me not to give up. 
   326
   I was 20 years old when that earthquake happened. I was in Southern Leyte at that time. I and my my co-workers are involved. I don¡¯t know what is happening, but that time I feel so scared and nervous because I was too far from my family. This experience stands out the most for me because this is the first time that I was not with my family.
   327
   I was 15 years old, November 8, 2013 in Barangay 35-A Pampango Tacloban City. I feel trauma, because my family, my brother and sister, I am thinking a lot of negative thoughts I feel stressed I thought I lost them.
   328
   I was 16 years old at the time when the typhoon happened. It was so alarming because we didn¡¯t know what to do and where to go. At that moment, I never knew what to do, I never stopped crying and thinking negative and saying ¡°Lord am I and my family going to die?¡± I thought of where to go and bring my family to a safe location were we can stay fo a moment. I saw a lot of houses flying in the air and explode just like a bomb and might scatter everywhere. I and my mother were the only people in our house because my sister and my brother are in school at that time. I and my mother hugged together while walking slowly, wearing a piece of cellophane as a protection from the drop of the rain. Our goal was to slowly go towards the school for us to save ourselves but at that point it wasn¡¯t easy because there were pieces of wood flying in the air and being swept by the wind. So much from those¡¦when we save ourselves, I experience depression, not in myself, I can¡¯t talk, I can¡¯t heat any sound just like when someone talked, I couldn¡¯t hear them at all.
   329
   I was 20 years old during that time, my mother didn¡¯t want me to leave out house and my father wanted to take care of our house so we call stayed not knowing there will be a storm surge. Unfortunately, we immediately notice the water  raising so we decided to go to our neighbor¡¯s house and go higher so the water won¡¯t reach us, I was holding my little brother when we were evacuating our house telling him not to be scared, I was really positive that everything will be okay and that bad situation didn¡¯t get into my head that¡¯s why I was able to stay calm and think that even though we were almost trapped, my father and big brother carried my mother and little sister and brother tube of our neighbor¡¯s house which had a second (upper) floor. I saw my father¡¯s eyes and it was bleeding and I was worried. When we all got on the second floor I stayed by my father¡¯s side and kept telling him to rest and stop worrying about our house.  I learned that after that disaster to not be scared no matter how bad the situation I¡¯m in, staying calm and clear mind is the best thing you can do during hard times. 
   330
   At the age of 17 I already experienced one of the strongest calamity like the Typhoon Yolanda, there¡¯s a lot of people who died because of the typhoon. I¡¯ve never been expecting that in November 8, 2013, there will be that calamity/disaster to hit out city. After the incident, I¡¯ve never expected also that there would be a lot of people who died,, but we were wrong. When the Typhoon hit us, I felt that I and my family were going to die because of the water that flowed up high and our house was shaking until it fell down but because of my family I became stronger and stronger and have faith to God that He can never let us down and die. I can say that because of this experience, you can never be weak but stay put together with your family so you can end up the struggle you are facing together until time heals everything.
   
   331
   At the age of 14 years old,  on November 8, 2013, that was the tragedy I experienced that day.  There were my family, cousins, friends, neighbors relatives and other people who experienced Typhoon Yolanda. It felt like it¡¯s gone and that it was the end of the world but still we fought that struggle we had. This experience showed me how to be powerful and have strong affection to my family and the responsibilities, always be ready no matter what happened in our life because we don¡¯t know out situations, what will happen every now and then, be faithful always to our God so that he guides us in out future.  
   332
   I was 16 years old. Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) happened way back 5 years ago, the typhoon mainly hit Tacloban City but there had been a huge damage since it also affected all of the neighboring municipalities and cities and caused so much damage as it left the places devastated and totally washed out. During Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) all I¡¯m thinking is to be saved and that my whole family can get through that event, although I was feeling afraid that time knowing that it¡¯s my first time facing that kind of event. I also thought we can surpass and still face a new day. My thought that day was filled with hope and courage because I was eager to be saved and my family. Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) left a mark to each person of Eastern Visayas especially in Tacloban City as this was the eye of the ¡°SUPER¡± typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). My first time to encounter this horrible event in my life. The typhoon brought so much damage as the city was devastated and many people were dead, lying in the streets, having in the streetlight posts and some were locked in the rooms. Yolanda (Haiyan) will never be forgotten as it is always being remembered every year and commemorating the lives stolen by the typhoon. 
   
   333
   I was 20 years old when Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) happened. I was in the house mom my grandparents during that day with my two brothers, Lola (grandmother) and lolo (grandfather). I felt nervous and afraid because I was thinking that our life will end that day seeing dark water running in and ruining the houses. I was crying the whole time because my Mama (mother) was not with us we were so hopeless with my siblings thinking that our mom was already drowning because our house had no second (upper) floor. But thanks to God when the rain and the wind slowly went away I saw my mom waving at us from afar, she was still alive with my stepfather. Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) stands out the most of my traumatic experiences I can say that I¡¯m truly a survivor I can conquer all my trouble and problems. Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) made me a better person.
   334
   I was in my 5th grade (about 11 years old) when I was diagnosed with a heart problem because of my high fever and tonsillitis that made me feel bad I was so depressed that time. I asked myself of all people in the world why would I experience this kind of illness. So far I keep my medication and here I am facing the world and I keep fighting.
   335
   I was 17 years old by the time Typhoon Haiyan struck Region 8. It was a devastating scenario to be in and I don¡¯t what it to happen again. It happened on November 8, 2013. The typhoon was huge just like what we saw on the television. Almost all of people in Samar and Leyte (provinces) were affected by it. At first, I thought that the typhoon is just the same as the other typhoons that hit us usually every year. But the time typhoon got closer, the feeling was also getting worse. This traumatic scene made by the typhoon made me and all survivors more cautious about the typhoon and it made us what we are today, we are more prepared when another natural disaster with such power come. 
   336
   I was 14 years old at that time, when the super typhoon named ¡°Yolanda¡± (Haiyan) made a landfall here in Tacloban. All the house that I see was destroyed by the typhoon, especially our farm it was totally damaged. It was on November 8, 2013, the most unforgettable moment that happened in my life. I feel scared and I am thinking about what will happen to us and sometimes I don¡¯t understand what I felt at that time. 
   337
   I was 15 years old at that time. There was a strong typhoon named ¡°Yolanda¡± (Haiyan) . It really destroyed our house, our farm, our church especially it really destroyed the entire place not only of Palo but there were also many places that were affected by the Typhoon. It happened almost 6 years ago. It was on November 8, 2013. This is the most unforgettable happening in my entire life. All of my family, cousins and neighbors were involved and were victims of that tragedy. I can¡¯t understand what I really felt at that time. Mixed emotions happened. I thought that it was my last day because of that very strong typhoon. I can definitely say that this tragedy was the most unforgettable moment, experience that I have encountered in my whole life.
   338
   I was 18 when I experienced Typhoon Yolanda last November 8, 2013 in our hometown in Alang-alang, Leyte. During that typhoon, we were in our house with my family and relatives, thinking how we might survive. We felt nervous and scared that time and we kept thinking if we would survive that time. 
   339
   It was November 8, 2013, I was 14 years old when the strongest typhoon happened in Eastern Visayas - specifically here in Tacloban City, that was Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). It was a very unexpected happening, I was thinking what was happening outside because the sound of the wind and the rain was so strange. I suddenly felt that uneasiness, worry and nervousness. It also gave me additional feeling when in the evening of that day there was a false rumor or information about another storm surge. Even it was very dark, we had to run as fast as we could just to go to the mountain, stayed there for almost 5 hours. That experience stands out because I think it gives us lessons that we should really protect our nature and we should always be alert and ready for what will happen.
   340
   I was 15 years old when it happened to our country especially to our Barangay (community) San Jose. There were many people especially my relatives involved in this experience. Thinking about what happened during Yolanda (Haiyan) there¡¯s so many people who died in a minute or hour that day. I experienced the part that my family was very afraid. That time the ¡°storm surge¡± hit my other friends and family and they died.
   341 
   When I was 15 years old, being a part of the LGBT, my grandmother was not happy that I was part of this, we had an argument about my gender preference that¡¯s why I felt I was down. Then my grandmother told me that soon I would go to jail. Until now I am thinking about what my grandmother said and I¡¯m scared someday it would happen. I still feel that I am not complete right now. 
   342
   I was 17 years old when my mother committed adultery. It really affected me because I didn¡¯t expect that my mother will do this thing and also because of this situation our family encountered very stressful and depressing problems. During that time, I felt very upset and angry but I told myself that I can fight it with the help of God and also with the help of people who are concerned with us. 
   343
   I was 15 years old that time when we experienced a very scary feeling that there were some terrorists who came to our Barangay (community) and had an encounter with the military. We felt that it was the end of our lives but thanks to God that it was controlled by the military and it was cleared that there were no more terrorists.
   344 
   I was 18 that time, i felt that everything I¡¯ve done is always wrong and it gave me negative thinking if I heard it personally. In our house, family & myself. If I die, there¡¯s no pain that I will feel because when I am alone, sometimes, I feel that anytime it will go back & thinking what I do wrong because I always think negative about myself because I like being alone.  
   345
   I was just 20 years old that time, my cousin died without findings. It was October 21, 2018, and no one was involved. I really felt so sad about what happened to him and there¡¯s a part of me that I feel so angry because the hospital didn¡¯t have any findings nor gave him medicine to make him better. The whole week of waiting about the findings was all useless because he died.
